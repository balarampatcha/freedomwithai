The duration of this masterclass is about 3 hours.
At the age of 17, Avinash ventured into two outings. One was dropshipping and the other one was affiliate marketing. And he had taken 10 lakh rupees of loan to venture into this business and to start something that is of his. But unfortunately, he lost a lot of money in dropshipping and affiliate marketing and that amount was 10 lakh rupees.  At that particular point of time, when you don't have money, you look at your parents and you think that they're going to come to the rescue. But unfortunately, again, for Avinash's case, his dad had 30 lakh rupees of debt. Now, this debt was because his dad wanted to help one of his cousins, but the cousin's business also did not take off. The loan was taken on his dad's name. So ultimately, that 30 lakh loan became his dad's. So at the age of 17, he had 40 lakh rupees of debt and nowhere to go.  During that time, during his lowest time, he came across this magazine while he was sitting in a library and he saw the face of Kylie Jenner on Forbes magazine and he read about her story and he got to know that she is one of the youngest billionaires of the world and he read about her story of how she built her business  on a tool where we spend most of our time doing nothing and that tool was Instagram. Her whole business model was thanks to the traffic, the amount of followers that she was able to generate on her Instagram. And he thought to himself that I also run some pages on Instagram, maybe I can also start my business on Instagram.  And he started spending a lot of his time. In fact, 14 to 18 hours of his time went into understanding the platform Instagram so that he can make money and he can get rid of his 40 lakh rupees of debt.  During this time, his friends were teasing. They were saying, why are you wasting your time? This is not the place where you spend your time and energy. You should come to classes. In fact, teachers were complaining that why is he not attending the classes? Because Avinash was spending all of his nights understanding the tool and experimenting and talking to different people.  His parents were also not happy that you know, why is our son not you know studying during this particular point of time when you know Your things are not working out for you. Everybody starts complaining and everybody's against you but Avinash did not give up he Had low CGPA and his 40 lakh rupees debt was still existing on his head And and when you know, you're in this position  If you come across a mentor, things change drastically. And that's what happened with Avinash. He came across this gentleman called Pena. He's from a small country called Dominican Republic.  And he understood what Pena was doing with Instagram. So he invested in Pena's course. In fact, he spent 70,000 rupees on Pena's course, and he got to learn everything about Instagram. This happened because he was able to beg, borrow 70,000 rupees from some of his close friends and family. And this literally helped him  crack his first client Nick Peroni and that was an international client ladies and gentlemen so his journey from being a nobody student to being a student who is in the college who has cracked an international client was just insane and with no time with the help of word of mouth he was able to generate more businesses because  His concept around using Instagram pages for business was incredible. He got featured in the Times of India as a 19-year-old boy making 80 lakh rupees in six months through Instagram. His news was everywhere. In fact, during our college time, even I saw this news and I was very happy.  And today he's got rid of the debt, he's got rid of the 40 lakh rupees that was on his head and on his parents' head as well. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome Avinash, the guy who turned adversity into opportunity and is here today as one of the leading mentors  in the AI world of our generation.

So now, if you consider yourself to be the beginner in terms of AI and all, it's type in the word B in the chat box, that means you spent almost no time in the last few months with ChatGPT, like hardly 10 hours a week. If you spend more than 10 hours of your time every single week on ChatGPT,  and consider yourself as an advanced attribute user type in the word a according to the people's a or B's. I'll just open the right presentation and cover everything from basics to advance. If we have a lot of beginners and if we have a lot of advanced people, I'll just you know, go a lot of basics. Perfect. Perfect. Amazing guys amazing. So what I'll do is I'll just open the right presentation in here.  of it guys I'll open the presentation. How many of you could see my screen where I said Avinash Mata and me and hear me perfectly type in the word yes in the chat box firstly welcome to freedom with AI masterclass next three hours of your life is going to be  amazing. For lack of better words, it's going to be something that you would not expect. Anyways, let me introduce myself a bit. I am Avinash Madha. I started this whole journey of me coming into digital marketing or entrepreneurial journey at the age of 17-18 when I am 20.  in the year 2018 and in the last two years we managed clients budgets of 120 crores and we used AI extensively in our marketing campaigns as a business owner as a digital marketing agency owner. We use AI left right center day in and day out. So that's the reason why you could listen to me about AI and get a lot of knowledge about AI in the next three four years.  Because we are using AI, our clients in the last two years at the same time when we spend like almost 120 crores, they made the revenue of 340 crores. 340 crores for the people who might not know it is upwards of 40-50 million dollars in clients trackable revenue through our marketing ads.  One of our biggest clients is into blockchain technology. When they came in, they're valued at 20 to 40, 50 million dollars at max. Now, after seven, eight months after joining us in 2022, they raised 100 million dollars at 1.5 billion dollars in valuation. And we did entire end-to-end marketing for them in almost every social media platform that we could imagine.  And the moment this was all going on at age of 19. I was featured in India's one of the top publications both in print magazine and in a distilled one for making 80 lakh rupees in six months, which is hundred K dollars in six months as a 19 year old dropout. I dropped out immediately after getting into Times of India and I gave a Joe stock which happened to be the top five  5th most watched Joe Stock of all time in the language of Telugu. For the people who don't know Joe Stock, it is like TED, but for India.  So you might be thinking Avinash, you are amazing. I can understand but why in the world I should listen to you when it comes to AI? Are you like the core data scientist and stuff like that? No, I'm not the core data scientist and stuff, but I use AI very extensively for my businesses for the last couple of years and we are making upwards of 25 lakh rupees per month or $30,000 rupees $30,000  per month in revenue consistently for the last two to three, two, two and a half years right now. So that is the reason why, and I'm talking only about my AI businesses. There are businesses that I do which are not related to AI, but related to AI, we make $30,000 per month. I'm sorry, we have lot of India and USA and UK crowd. For me, I have to convert almost every single number into both so that everyone will have contextually right thing.  So now honestly guys every single one of you could safeguard your career. You will have a plan you will have a roadmap to safeguard your career by end of this masterclass. I could assure you that there is no way that you can't safeguard your career. If you complete this masterclass and get yourself certified.  On top of safeguarding your career, you could also potentially 3x your income using AI in the next 12 months, if you have a right mindset. The reason I believe mindset is more important than skill set and tool citizen is because, you know, you see any richest billionaire in the world, they are billionaires, millionaires and successful because of their mindset, but not because of the skill set. Bill Gates is a billionaire and one of the richest person because of his  Mindset. Elon Musk went on to do things that humanly not possible is because of his mindset, not skill set, not tool set. There are, I'm sure Sundar Pichai is not the best coder in the whole company Google, but still he is the CEO because he have a right mindset of a leader. So now how many of you believe mindset is more important than skill set? Type in the word mindset in the chat box if you completely agree with me. Perfect.  Perfect guys amazing. Thank you. Cool. So if you stay till the very end, you will get 15,000 rupees or $200 worth of bonuses including expert certificate in  you know AI and ChatGPT once you complete will give you a Google phone. We have to fill it and the moment you fill it in the next two to three working days. You will get your certificate to your email on top of it will give you playbooks. This playbooks will be amazing use cases.  for students working professionals could be any working professional any executive professional or if you are someone who are into business or self-employed this playbooks will be the world of use cases for you. And now how many of you are here for this bonuses type in the word $200 in the chat box or 15,000 rupees in the chat box. If you are here for all this bonuses upon completion of this master class.  We are literally incentivizing you a lot more just to complete this masterclass because completion is more important than start starting. How many of you believe that completing is more important than starting? How many of you believe that type in the word? Yes in the chat box. Amazing. Amazing. Great guys. Great. Cool. Perfect. Perfect.  Now, you are just one year away with AI. The money you want, the marriage you want, the family you want is directly going to be determined by AI in just 12 months. You might be thinking, Avinash, what in the world are you even doing by comparing my family, my life with AI? I completely understand and empathize with you, but let me  throw you a harsh reality of the world that is happening right now. If you see right now in the world, there is so much going on. Politically, there are almost three set of countries, which means six countries are actually fighting war between themselves, including Israel, Iran, Palestine, you know, a lot more Russia, Ukraine, all that.  Politically, we're at the worst state after World War 2 right now. In like last 100 years approximately, this has been one of the worst political situations right now. This could lead to a recession or a potential depression that could create a lot of job loss. Option number one. Option number two, the situation number two, here right now is  Now, economically, UK is in preposition officially. US has more debt than the history of that particular country, United States of America. It never had that much of debt in the history. But right now, it has.  Almost all the European countries are facing a lot of economic crisis including non-European countries like China. China, a lot of economic slowdown because all the companies are going away from China and starting their factories in other Asian countries like India and other countries.  On top of this, there is this thing called AI automation recently, which is also causing job losses. Like 40,000 people lost their job in the last few days because of AI automation from all the big countries like Paytm, Google, Meta, Microsoft and a lot more.  right so when all this is happening there is a potential possibility of decision and a very huge possibility of a layoff when decision happens and all this is happening if some at least one out of these three situations prevail to be true  You know what happens? Companies will have every single reason to lay off employees for multiple reasons. When they are replacing teams of 100 with 20, you know what will happen? You know who will survive? Someone who could do more work in less time by being more productive by using AI could be surviving in the company than anyone else.  a python developer with two years experience plus lot of AI usage in his or her workflow is going to be more valued with 20 years python experience a developer but who doesn't use AI in his workflow at any cost who will be valued more number one or number two type in the type in one or two in the chat box type in the  or two in the chat box. Lot of people are saying one absolutely true. Python developer or any white-collar jobs AI is making experience-redundant because you know, anyone with AI could do a lot especially in the next six months when ChatGPT-5 comes in when Devon comes in maybe not Devon but auto GPT comes in or you know, GitHub copilot workspace comes in  These are like apps that could potentially like do 10x more work than an average developer. That is what we're talking about. Now you see me don't you think AI will be an armor when it comes to this situation type in the word? Yes, if you agree hundred person with me that the statement that is flashing on screen right now. Is it true or false type in the word? Yes or no in the chat box.  You know, that is a sad reality guys. AI could be your armor. The world is not economically or politically in the worst state top economists in the world are predicting. In fact depression the person who predicted recession in 2018 just few months before actual decision. He's not predicting depression. Hopefully will not reach there. But then there is a possibility of even a depression in next few months in USA. And if that happens in USA whole  world will see the repercussions in some sort or form and UK and Japan have been into recession officially and USA now has 85% chance of a decision in 2024 which is the highest probability since the greatest financial crisis according to economist David Rosenberg.  You see everything is aligning guys, everything is saying the same thing. A potential decision could create layers, a potential layers could just replace everyone with zero AI expertise or most of the people with zero AI expertise. How many of you agree with me? Type in the word yes in the chat box.  Perfect. Cool. So now, now that the context of why AI is important, let's go understand what is AI. See, AI is a software or an algorithm that thinks like humans by mimicking human brain. Perfect. Write things down guys. Writing is very important. How many of you are writing this? Type in the word I in the chat box if you're writing it. Perfect. Perfect. AI  is a algorithm or a software that thinks like humans by mimicking human brain that is what AI is. Now we humans invented AI so that AI could do lot of tasks that we don't enjoy which are like redundant, uncreative, boring tasks.  But the irony of the entire century is AI is not only doing those boring and uncreative tasks, but it is also doing creative tasks just like humans. In fact better than 80% of humans right now. I'm not talking about the future. AI is doing much creative tasks that 80% of humans will not be able to do right now. How many of you agree with me type in the word? Yes in the chat box. Yes.  Perfect. Perfect. See it. We invented that for something else. It is doing that something else with everything else. That is what we're talking about. It is creating logos, editing videos, creating designs, creating PPTs, creating, you know, videos of, you know, stock footages from scratch, Sora.ai, a lot more. We'll show and we'll talk about a lot of AI tools. Just be tuned.  Now, now that we understood what is AI and how, you know, you know, it was it basically works. Now, let's understand how it works in in-depth manner. Right. So now.  For every, you know, AI app, they need to have a foundation model. What is foundation model? It's a piece of code and math in it that acts like a brain for any AI app. It's a machine learning code to be very specific. To this foundation model, we have to train this with a lot of data. That data could be in any of the format that we mentioned here, like text, images, speech, structure, data, 3D signals.  So once this data goes into a foundation model that thinks like humans by mimicking human brain, this human brain will be understanding by figuring out patterns, all that. So once it gets all the pattern observations done, it will be able to do all the tasks that we potentially do. It could include question answering, sentimental analysis, information extraction, image captioning, object recognization, and instruction following. This is how AI works.  Type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you're learning something new, is it something new that you're learning type in the word? Yes in the chat box. You might be thinking.  Avinash, I'm a business owner. Why are you teaching this technical part to me? Trust me by end of this masterclass, you will understand why I am teaching everything to you because as a business owner, you also need to understand how the back end of AI works to be the good front-end user of ChatGPT or any other AI app. This is the reason why I am saying everything little more in-depth so that  you will have the better context of using this AI tools. Perfect. If you are a business owner type in the word BO in the chat box, type in the word BO in the chat box. Amazing Sheikh, Nathiamullah Sheikh CCS, Prashant Kumar, BO Sneha, Prashant Kumar, Bunny, Trivikram, Kanchapo, Sheikh Asiyallah, Prashant Kumar. Perfect. Perfect. Great. Let's go ahead. Let's go ahead. Now, why you should care about this whole AI thing.  7 out of top 10 most valued companies in the world are spending all their money energy into one technology which is AI which never happened in the history of humanity that 7 or 6 or 5 companies even investing everything they have into just one technology at one point of time. It never happened with internet revolution, computer revolution, mobile revolution. There are many companies working with  Many you know different areas, but right now every company know that AI is the most important thing that they could invest. When their R&D budgets of one single company is more than everyone  presents here, all our net worth combined would be less than their R&D budgets. They are spending their money in AI. When big money spends and does something, average money and small money like us could just barely, you know, should understand what's going on. You know, how many of you agree that big money knows something that small money don't know? Type in the word yes in the chat box if you agree with me.  Perfect. Perfect. Thanks guys, including Apple. I didn't mention Apple here, but even Apple is going all in on AI. So let's go next. So one of the most crucial statements in the last five years was said by Sundar Pichai. It changes the way I thought about AI. He says, AI's bigger paradigm shift than electricity. The very technology that changed everything for humanity, which is electricity,  Everything we do including the water we are drinking is because of electricity. And this person, the most respected CEO of the world right now comes out and says AI is actually bigger paradigm shift than electricity. Think about it for a second.  You are investing on a technology that will not just be a soul technology, but a technology that will impact billions of other technological Innovations and experts says AI could be the last important inventions of humanity. Yep. Processing make sense type in the word Ms in the chat box makes sense Ms in the chat box. If this totally makes sense to you.  Am I making sense? Yes, or I'm talking BS at the word MS or BS in the chat box. We'd love to see your opinions. Thanks a lot. Yes. Thank you. It's not now that we understood AI. Let's go understand. What is ChatGPT? So ChatGPT, you know. Every important mobile app that we are using including YouTube, they talk Instagram all the recommendations. Work because of AI.  But when you are when these guys are building their AI algorithms, they use data of the users of their own apps like Google will use their own users data Facebook their own users data all that. All right, but what ChatGPT thought is he if he has super powerful because of the date of one single app users data, how powerful AI could get if we could crawl entire World Wide Web  and train it to a algorithm that thinks like humans by mimicking human brain. This is what they thought and literally crawled every single web page that could legally be crawled  and they trained with an AI algorithm or a machine learning algorithm and that is a reality that we are seeing which is ChatGPT. ChatGPT read every single web page on the internet literally. The better questions that you ask to ChatGPT, the better crawling of information happens and the presentation happens to you. It's all about the way you talk to ChatGPT, the way the techniques that you use while talking to ChatGPT.  How many of you understood what you type in the word? Yes in the chat box. If you want a one-liner definition ChatGPT is a large language model that has been trying every single web page on World Wide Web to be able to answer every and almost every single question that humans have it is a large language model that has been trying with every single web page on the internet.  to just answer every single questions that we humans would have potentially in the next one to two years. It is almost answering everything but in the next one to two years, you can't just know what ChatGPT cannot do, cannot answer like that will be the situation when ChatGPT 5, 5.5 and 6 comes in to the world. So that is how ChatGPT works guys. That is what ChatGPT is. Now let's understand how ChatGPT works. Remember  This is the most important slide of this entire 3 hours masterclass. Please pay utmost focus despite you being a student, working professional, non-IT, IT, it could be anyone or a business owner. This is very important to understand. It is like a summary of entire knowledge that we had so that we could go forward.  with a great context perfect type in the word ready in the chat box. If you're ready and excited to learn this particular slide, which is how ChatGPT works. Amazing. Let's go. You see open AI the company that owns the you know ChatGPT. He has an access to supercomputer.  In that supercomputer, they run something called Transformers. Irony again here is Transformers was invented by Google and used in a best way by ChatGPT. So Transformers, they run this whole technology called Transformers. It is open source model, if I'm not wrong, that's the reason ChatGPT is able to use it. So now, so they run something called Transformers as a technology. So before we understand what is Transformers,  you know to this transformers they crawl entire World Wide Web right every single web page and process the data in a such a way that transformers would understand with zero questions asked the whole journey or the whole soul rethink that transformers needs to understand is  every single webpage on the internet will be crawled and sent to transformers it needs to observe things it needs to observe trillions of things and conclude billions of things from all the experiment stations and observations that they do during the process of from input embedding to output probabilities during this whole process all it does is  figuring out what humans talk, how humans talk and every data that is potentially available. That's what cold transformers do. How? Let me give you how humans invented this technology. Very simple. Transformers is a technology or an algorithm or a software that just doesn't mimic human brain on a surface level but in a deep level by mimicking human neural network.  Right? What are human neural networks? Simple. See, inside your brain, it's nothing but flushless neurons. Your brain is nothing but a bunch of neural networks. That's it. Every decision that you take  from drinking water when you're thirsty to slapping someone when you're angry is done by neurons in your brain. The more neurons you are able to connect in your brain, the more mature that you get. When you're a kid, it doesn't make sense a lot of time because less neurons being connected. But the more training the parents give to that kid, that kid will activate those neurons and become matured. In a similar way,  transformers use that neural network technology to be able to do things like actual humans. So they thought hey, you know, AI is great as doing all this by just mimicking human brain, but how about actually mimicking human neural network this time and they thought it the build transformers and you know the history using this transformers it figured out  billions of parameters by observing trillions of things about humans from all over the internet by this company called OpenAI. So once this transformers is done, we will not discuss every single step in the transformers because that will take 3 hours of your time which could be boring for 99000 other people. Right?  So that's what the Transformers does next step is once this Transformers understand everything it goes into Alpha stage Alpha stage is where they almost have it, but they need to trust test if things are working right or wrong. This is where all your a lot of exams happen. They'll test.  alpha stick product of ChatGPT  left right center by asking the most stressful questions that they could ask. If it passes the test and criteria it goes to next stage which is beta stage. Beta stage is where public will get the hold of ChatGPT and the next stage which is beta stage is GPT 3. GPT stands for generative  pre-trained transformers. The reason which is generative is they use something called generative AI as a technology inside transformers. That's why they kept the word generative and P stands for pre-trained because the transformers is pre-trained and T stands for transformers.  You know pretty obvious generated pre-trained transformers 3 stands for the third version of it. They did this whole thing for third time. That's why it's 3 but right now it's 4.5. They did it almost for 4 times plus mini cycle, which is 4.5 turbo that we are having right now, which is the latest version of ChatGPT. Then from the people's feedback from the beta stage, it goes to the next stage, which is instructivity.  Instruct GPT is a step where they take all the feedback and train the GPT much much further by giving communication skills and real-life skills in an in-depth manner. That is how chat GPT is born. Type in the word yes if you would understand if you understood at least 25% of what we discussed on this slide. Type in the word yes in the chat box. For the few people who might be typing in the word no,  I'll quickly summarize this in under a minute. ChatGPT has an access to a supercomputer and this supercomputer runs something called Transformers. Transformers is a technology that thinks like human by mimicking human neural network, right? Mimicking human neural network is almost like an artificial brain. So to this artificial brain or Transformers, they dump in large amount of data, trillions of things.  So it's RGPD needs to understand all the things in the string of things and need to conclude billion things while there is no questions asked. It just need to understand the patterns just like in a baby said till 0 to 4 like moms and dads rule ask a lot of questions. It just a lot of observation observing happens to the kid and once kid reaches the age of 8 9 parents starts asking questions. Why what how all that stuff.  So so no questions asked during this process of training. Once it gets to conclude all these observations, it goes to Alpha stage and it needs to be a very tough exam. If it clears the criteria, it goes to beta stage, which is public beta review. So once they get all the feedback, it goes to communication skills and real life skills training under instructivity step. Once it clears that, that is where we have ChatGPT twins.  How is it? Are you guys learning something new? Yes, type in the word yes in the chat box if you're learning something amazing and something new. And the reason I am not able to speak in the word Telugu, Hindi or any other regional language because we have people from 35 countries. I'm sorry for that. Thank you. Perfect. Type in the word yes in the chat box guys. Type in the word yes in the chat box.  Perfect. Perfect. Ayesha CCS, Saiteja CCS, Bittu CCS, Sanjeev, Manikonda, Nagarjuna, Aishwarya, Uday, Tirumalesh, Abhiram. Perfect. Rahul. Perfect. Perfect. Let's go. Let's go, guys. Let's go. So now, why you should care about ChatGPT? Pretty simple. Verbal IQ of ChatGPT is 155. Can anyone in the audience  Guess the verbal IQ of this particular person who is Einstein. Tap in the word. Akshit got it right.  There were a lot of people predicted it like Ali says exact answer. Yes one Sneha Balakrishna Mayank Dixita Syed. A lot of people already know this answer. I guess then perfect. The answer is 160. Verbal IQ of Einstein is 160 and ChatGPT is 155. That means we almost have  Einstein as assistant. We have an assistant as smart as Einstein that is available to us 24 by 7, 365 days through our mobile phones, through ChatGPT app or absolutely for free or maybe you should pay $20 a month if you need some advanced stuff. Understand that? You right now has Einstein as your assistant  What does that mean, guys? If everyone in the world has an assistant as smart as Einstein, what would happen to the world? Type in your answers here. What do you think? Kiran says disruption. Absolutely. Karthik says destruction. Large-scale development. Sangeeta says, oh my God. Prashant Kumar says gone.  Banish says revolution, amazing, miraculous, world is becoming artificial, yes, artificially more intelligent, gone, genius, revolution, collapse, transformation, kaboom, I don't know the meaning of the word, very knowledgeable, rumbling, improvement, phenomenal, disaster, life changer, blast, world will change, lol, jobs reduction, absolutely correct.  Bhoomika is absolutely right. While in the long term, we might have abundance of health, wealth, knowledge and happiness, but in the short term,  Jobs will be lost. Let me explain you why very simple. You see ChatGPT or AI tools has already made developers 2 to 3x faster all the developers out there in the world and right now in this room. Do you agree the ChatGPT and AI has made your life at least two times productive type in the word. Yes in the chat box, right in next two more years.  the word the developer will be 10 times more productive. That means if a average developer is 10 times more productive. 100 member job will be done by 10 members tab in the word. Yes, if you agree. If 10x productive productivity happens for an average developer, you would do the 10 members to the job of 100 members. So now when this happens when 10 members do the job of 100 members,  Why would a company need 100 members to do the same task? They might need 20 to have the managers on top of the line, you know, management. So, 100 member job is now being done by 20 members. This means the other 80 members who are not productive, don't have expertise could be in danger.  And for companies right now, they have two opportunities now to get rid of this 80% of the people part ways with them or go increase their marketing budgets and fulfill more projects as a service technical service company like TCS Infosys.  But you see as a 40 50 60 billion dollar companies 10xing their marketing budgets and getting more people on board takes three years and during again those three years AI will become more productive and become 10x more powerful that again this 20 members job 20 members will be doing those 10x more projects also. You see this is the world that we are going in.  So no matter what 80% of job relevancy that we have right now for developers or in fact any white-collar jobs.  could be changed it starts from 50 percent and could go all the way around 80 percent depending upon the area that you are in just for this reason how many of you agree with me type in the word yes and this is the reason why I say a short-term job disruption is bound to happen while in the long term everything is good and this short-term disruptions  is very obvious when internet came in people lost jobs when computers came in people lost jobs when mobile phones came in people lost jobs when youtube came in a lot of people lost jobs when camera or drones came in people's lost job every time a technological revolution happens some jobs will be lost but because of ai right now it could be a hugely you know inevitable thing perfect so this is the reason why short-term job loss and long-term all good  You have to prepare for it. Now what ChatGPT could do ChatGPT could do amazing coding. It's almost good. It's it makes an average order two times more productive. But the thing which are quarters in the in the world right now is can I give you a little harsh reality about the world of quarters again type in the word? Yes in the chat box type in the word. Yes in the chat box.  ChatGPT increases productivity of an average developer. I'm not talking about every developer an average developer. If you take an average, it makes an average developer on average two times more productive, right? So now. See. World of coders, you know, or non-coders, IT professionals to be very specific.  You know, 80% of IT professionals are basic. The top 20% are the decision makers. This could be your product managers, senior product managers, your general managers, or it could be your CTOs, CEOs. These are the very people in any company that takes decisions  give you standard operating procedures give you text at everything and gives all the instructions that you need and 80% of the people need to follow this all the interrupts instructions like a proper like instruction follower. So in this 21st, that's it. They just use this instructions plus a little bit of knowledge. They have using Kaggle stack overflow Google ChatGPT. They just complete the projects like that.  Little bit of creativity is needed but not a lot. How many of you agree with the statement right now type in the word? Yes in the chat box type in the word. Yes are 80% out of professionals are basic this 20% take all the decisions 80% follow the instructions. Now, if you see Average IQ of human is 120 right chat GPT's IQ is 155.  That means ChatGPT don't even need to be extra smart to replace lot of this average people ChatGPT just needs to be little better than this average people. It just needs to be above average to replace majority of this it professionals. How many of you agree tab in the word? Yes in the chat box. If you agree ChatGPT just needs to be above average to replace majority of this it professionals who are average.  Yes. And that is not just true with IT. It is true with video editing. It is already being done with content writing for a long time for you name any white-collar industry 40 to 80 percent of the jobs will have no relevance in the next two to three years because of this one reason because AI is becoming much much smarter in fact better than humans and in two to three years  AI could be more smarter than every smartest human combined.  And you might be thinking Avinash, why in the world are you hyping up like this? Like you are hyping as if Prashant Neel hypes his heroes. No guys, I'm not hyping up. It is reality. World's biggest billionaires, Sam Altman, Elon Musk and all the biggest and richest people in the world agree with this. Why in the world a richest man in the world comes out and says AI is more dangerous than nukes and you have to pause AI development for six months?  And he is pro-business and pro-development. And this guy comes out and says, hey, stop everything about AI for six months. We have to, you know, go with caution. It's something very dangerous. I'm not hyping up. I'm not, you know, doing all that things. It is experts already doing it. I am just being a facilitator, facilitating things to you. Perfect, guys. Everyone agrees?  Type in the word. Yes, if you agree that 80% of white-collar jobs are under risk because of AI. Type the word yes in the chat box and you can absolutely say no guys. If you don't agree with me at any point of time, I more than I would be more than happy to disagree with you. That's okay. Perfect. Thank you guys. Thanks a lot.  So now let's go a little quicker. ChatGPT can write books both fiction and nonfiction. ChatGPT could summarize complex articles, complex books in simple words in like very few lines to make you understandable.  ChatGPT can write great content. ChatGPT ChatGPT could be your personal tutor one-on-one teaching anything from basic communication to very advanced philosophy. You could be learning all those stuff under, you know, ChatGPT as your personal tutor.  ChatGPT could do all your HR activities ChatGPT could do all the search engine, you know stuff whatever you could search on search engine ChatGPT will be able to do all that you could do all that internally and get answers faster and more productive all that. Now, let's spend 15 to 20 minutes of time by watching 15 videos in the next 20 minutes and understand if ChatGPT alone is this powerful. How about the whole AI?  Can we do that type in the word? Yes, if you're excited to watch this 15 small small one-minute videos to change your perspective. About AI type in the word. Yes in the chat box. Perfect. Perfect guys. Perfect.  Okay, cool. And is Kundan answering all of your questions? Are you satisfied that your answers are getting perfectly answered? Type in the word Kundan in the chat box if you're receiving, you know, okay. Type in the word Kundan in the chat box. For all the basic questions, he might not be able to answer like hi and all, but you know, a lot of questions which are like good, he's answering. Perfect, perfect.  Kundan k-u-n-d-a-n perfect perfect cool guys amazing Kundan speed up a lot of people needs lot of answers it seems like it but yeah let's go what current AI could do text to image let's watch this video and understand how you're entering a text into a AI tool and getting an amazing image out  No audio. Intentionally there is no music or audio. No Kundan is not a chat bot guys. Don't worry. You see.  this lady that you're seeing is 100% AI generated. Someone used mid-journey to generate a small kid and aged that kid till 70 years using the same mid-journey. The tool here they used is mid-journey and the best part here is  just see the realness here the jewelry the skin you know even the bindi and then the nose pin if you see at one point of time he even had a nose pin but then got rid of nose pin in the next ages uh i don't know uh you know the sari the jewelry the wrinkles the white hair in here you know the eyes like  Isn't this amazing? What is the first word that you got into your brain when you realize that this is really AI generated? Type in the word, the first word that you got inside your brain. Someone says, wow, amazing, mind-blowing, damn, whoa, oh my God, unbelievable. Wow, wow, sick, fabulous. I'm learning more vocabulary right now. Great. So this is how it works, guys. So now, how many months do you think an average artist  a digital artist would need to draw something like this. Tabular word, month, how many months? 1, 2, 3, how many months do you think? 2 weeks, 4 months, 2 months, 1 month, 12 months. I would at least say it takes around 3 weeks to draw 7-18 images of same lady, aging and stuff like that. And this is done by 15 minutes in mid-journey right now.  It is not 10x more faster, not 100, it is 1000x faster than human right now and almost able to generate indistinguishably good images. Yes, and if AI could do this much creative stuff like drawing an image of a lady which is so realistic.  It could easily do logos PPTs websites, which are very or any complex UI UX screen as a visual designer could be done right now. It is being done. I'm not talking about the future. If you are a visual designer pay very close attention for the next 15-20 minutes. This is just going to blow your mind off. Like if you are a visual designer not using AI  under trouble under attack if you are a visual designer type in the word V D VD stands for visual designer type in the VD and if you're mind-blown by this if you are a visual designer and mind-blown by this type in the word VD VD is not Vijaya Deva Konda. It's VJ. Sorry, you know visual designer. Yep, perfect Cool let's go So text to music  How many of you know this guy? The guy who is flashing on screen type in the word yes in the chat box. Yes, perfect.  Yeah, if you talking to me, baby, then you talking to me nice. She's being a doll, she's on the night. Talking to hoes, I'm waiting for light. I got a pussy for guessing my eyes. She's trying to fuck, but I ain't into them nights. I don't want to be on here and they right. All you dames, I know what you like. Bitch, I'm a doll, so I don't bite. Flipping that shit with all of my might. I got a couple of demons I fight. Making these plans, I'm back on the site. All of my diamonds, they black or they white. She want to know me, I'm keeping it light. I couldn't afford to have that in my life.  i keep walking i'm back on my bike keeping it beat i'm pushing this pipe each other day man i'm running the lights i can't believe that she fit in them tights buying it once buying it twice swiping this car don't ask for the price sexy and rare she said i'm uptight i got a check but i'm ironing my thighs feeding her pussy like that's your device baby you know i'm not good at advice  Why would I go if I don't get advice? Takin' these chances, rollin' the dice. Started from nothin', don't hit any ice. All because what I been spittin' on these bikes. Need a few things inside of my Sprite. Better let her see if you want my advice. Thought I could trust you all my life. Can't even trust you with a knife. It's all to me, baby, it's all to me, nice. It's all to me, baby, it's all to me, feelin' the hate. Funny how love can turn you away. Funny how love can turn you away. Funny how love can turn into hate. Funny how love  Guys, this is completely AI generated. Lyrics, music,  the the vocals of the exact singer Drake everything is AI generated. What was the first word that you got in front in your mind when you heard this? I want first word to be typed out in the chat box right now. And they use different tools like chat GPT uber duck and Suno AI. These are the few music generation here tools for all the musicians are there if you are a musician, I'm sorry, if you are a musician type in the word music in the chat box.  Amazing. Amazing. Sneha is a musician. Sanjana is a musician. Wow. We have a lot of musicians also. And now, what will this do to our musicians? You know, the music directors. Do you think it will make job of music directors 10x easy?  a director could sit with AI in the future and generate their own songs with the lyrics that a lyricist would give or maybe a Telugu version of chat jeopardy would give or you know any version of chat jeopardy would give how many of you think that is a very high possibility type in the word possible in the chat box if there is a possibility amazing now  How many of you felt this is very real? Type in the word real in the chat box if you feel this is actually good and real. Perfect. And that's what we're talking about. AI is doing visual design and AI is doing music. Let's see what else AI could do. Presentations. Type in the word yes in the chat box if you make at least one presentation a month in your office or in your business or as a student.  What's this?  I'm going to go ahead and close out the meeting.  That's gamma.app for you.  No matter how much complex presentation that you do in office, you could literally take note of all the requirements that you have in your presentation from your brain to a Google Doc. Copy that requirement, paste it in the ChatGPT and ask it to prepare content for your presentation worth 10 slides. Copy it.  paste it in this and your presentation is done in under five minutes. How many hours a person like you and me who isn't not into design would need to do a presentation like this. How many hours type in number of hours 12 man hours 40 man hours 2 hours 4 hours 3 hours 48 hours something like that.  For a non-designer especially. Yes, it takes at least a minimum of five hours. So now you see Five hours job is done being done in five minutes. In fact better. I would never make a presentation this good in my life as a non-designer. We all agree that can you make this kind of a presentation like this professional in it five to six hours.  Yes or no? Very difficult, right? Maybe if you are very good at presentations, yeah. So this is taking away jobs of all those people who just do presentations for their life. It makes their job 10 to 20x easier. That makes 80% less requirement in jobs. Is it? Yes? Cool.  This is what we're talking about gamma. It's very easy guys. Like you literally write something what you need. It will make your presentation in a minute or two. That's how easy it is. And let's now see movies. We are all interested in movies, right? We all watch a movie a month at least. Let's now see how this AI is impacting the world of movies. This is  text to video, entering text and getting video in 2023, one year back.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  This is text to video right now. What is the first word that you got in your mind?  for watching this video type it in the chat box and the tool name is Sora.ai by open AI like you see the clarity guys like you know that no wonder why movies like Hanuman in Telugu use lot of AI this one shot would take if you get a real fox forget about real fox even in the green screen it takes a lot of effort to generate this  And it is now done in like a second if you explain the scene. A 20 second scene is just getting in 20 seconds actually. A 20 second scene in movie needs like 5 days, 4 days, 10 days in general. And now, click of a button. If you are a VFX artist and mind blown by this, type in the word VFX in the chat box. Filmmakers are also in the danger.  yeah the reason why the movie telugu and indian movie hanuman you know  did wonders with a budget of 40 crores instead of 100 crores is because they used AI in like most of the things I could literally sense a lot of AI generated footage including that big Hanuman you know statue on you know that particular you know the river is actually I'm sure it is AI generated I could literally sense it and with a little bit of VFX mixing happened post that  And director himself said lot of shots were actually AI generated out of mid journey and all they just added the video effect of it the storyboarding the story writing everything. That's the reason they made it super amazing, but very fast cool. Yeah, Adipush didn't use AI. Yeah. Yep, it's enough. Let's watch this.  Here I stand, standing before you, and I know that you are with me, and I know that you are with me, and I know that you are with me, and I know that you are with me, and I know that you are with me, and I know that you are with me.  Yes, how many of you think this particular TV commercial that you saw is better than 90% TV commercials that we see on a daily basis type in the word. Yes, type in the word. Yes. All they used is ChatGPT to get the script and the concept of this particular TV commercials and then they went on to run way ML exact tool to just paste that particular script.  20 minutes then done with the video with a budget of less than 40-50 dollars one man the director did it all. You see that reason why I am hyping up AI a lot. This would require a 5 to 6 member team 3 to 4 dogs 7 to 8 days and 10 lakhs in budget or $20,000 in budget to do this.  And this is done 10,000x faster in 20 minutes and with 10,000x cheaper with less than $50 in investment and the result people would not even know it is AI generated until someone says it to them. Even if they know AI generated the curiosity is like 5x more to see how AI is doing this amazing job already. How many of you are mind-blown? How many of your filmmakers are mind-blown? Type in the word FM filmmakers.  if you are mind blown right now. FM. Prakshita says FM. Arjun says FM. Ananya says FM. Ali says FM. Sneha, Vardhan, Harisha, Antonia. Windows 10. Amazing. Great. So AI is not generating random videos. It is also generating a perfect concept video. It is how you use AI tools matters. It's not about the AI tool itself.  You will be mind blown. Pay attention.  is for the people who didn't get the context. The first one is not in the robot. It's not a arrow about fighting like a human. No, I'm not talking about the robot here. The video that's down is a real video and in the video the top which is generated by an AI tool called wonder dynamics a human is dragged and dropped in a moving 2d scene. With a robot. Click of a button.  you could generate a like you could get one video shot with someone else and if you don't like the actor drag and drop to any other actor that you wish and the reason they had the robot here is you know, obviously, you know to be compliant and you know, they need a lot of you know structured, you know, kind of scans of a human to be able to keep a human they have robot here. They just put robot  how difficult it is for an average VFX artist to do something like this and the tool name is Wonder Dynamics. So you could literally duplicate the video with someone else like a dupe of Shah Rukh Khan of Mahesh Babu or  You know any Tom Cruise could do the video or to do the fight scene and Tom Cruise dupe will be replaced with the real Tom Cruise after the movie is done. And this generally right now takes a lot of time for a VFX artist to do but now matter of 10-15 minutes to load like 2 minutes to do actually do it and 20 minutes to render it and get it to you. That's it. This is the VFX I'm talking about. Perfect. Cool.  And last but not least, watch this.  You see guys, people with a basic VFX knowledge in the next one to two years will be able to do a graphics or VFX like Avatar or  Bahubali here in India sitting from their bedrooms and bathrooms that will be the future that we're talking about it sounds crazy but see this like this animated kind of movies need lot of budgets you know lot of you know media houses spends crores or millions of dollars and this lady did with this one tool called runway ml nine months back right now runway ml is much advanced i'm showing you the nineties behind example  and there are many other tools called kyber.ai and you know there are tools like Pika labs and Sora AI is not out but once Sora AI is out it will just eat out every single competition that it could. Now that movies is done how many of you are coders who know the repository called github type in the word github git in the chatbot if you know what is github all the coders  Let's do it type in the word get in the chat box. There is something that will just Again, blow your blow your mind off. You might be thinking avinash. Why are you not talking about us coders? You started with coding and now you're not talking about coding. This is the slide for you amazing cool watch this Yeah  Let's start with this. I think we always have to look at the unchanging between the best of the inevitable. So an inevitable is 41% of all code on GitHub right now is AI generated. Wow. To six months. ChatGPT can pass a Google level three programmer exam and it will run pretty much on a MacBook or a phone. And that's this year. This year, right now. Yeah. There are no programmers in five years. No programmers in five years.  So those of you with kids who you were having, you know, with Python lessons and so forth, maybe it's instead helping them to understand how to ask great questions or give great directions or prompts. I think we always have to look at the unchanging versus the inevitable. So an inevitable is 41% of all code on GitHub right now is AI generated. Wow. To six months.  Challenge APT can pass a Google Level 3 programmer exam and it will run pretty much on a MacBook or a PC. And that's this year? This year, right now. Yeah. There are no programmers in five years. No programmers in five years. So those of you with kids who you're having, you know, with Python lessons and so forth, maybe it's instead helping them to understand how to ask great questions or give great directions or prompts. I think we always have  Any thoughts guys? How many of you agree with this particular person? This guy is a CEO of a most respected AI company called stable diffusion and open source, you know image generation platform stable diffusion most respected. He was in space of AI. He himself would have 500,000 developers working for his own company comes out and says there are no developers in 510 years down the line. How many of you almost agree with this guy time the word? Yes in the chat box. If you agree with this guy,  Yep. See, I personally don't 100% agree with this guy, but I get what he means. Like what he is saying is, five years down the line, every developer, everyone will be a developer. Everyone will be able to create, you know, a lot of apps themselves without any coding language. So when everyone is a developer,  it becomes a rat race of who does it faster and better that's it coding knowledge will not be you know matter only thing is who does it faster and better agreed type in the word yes and now the reason why he's saying there will be no developers is because everyone is a developer when everyone is a developer no one is actually developer right like when everyone can code  like what is the designation coder mean or an IT professional mean like it loses the value that what he sees will still have dedicated developers but you know not a lot of them is what he sees which I agree but not 100% he just said it to just to make more sense of it but then not 100% but maybe 80% 70% but the direction is that  Number one number two. The reason why he says is, you know, there's this thing called GitHub GitHub is like a repository of hosting codes doing all that. 40% of the code hosted on GitHub after six months of ChatGPT release. Is done by AI just in six months a repository, which is like 10 years old with zero core, you know, a I code for like almost 8 to 10 years.  Just in six months, an entire code of all time is 40% of it is in it by AI. Imagine that.  Top corporates still don't allow AI usage in their companies, but still 40% of the coders by July of 2023 uses AI. And what will this number be? How much percentage of code in GitHub will be generated by AI in the next one year? Any guesses? Type it in the chat box. Type in the chat box. Security is just a myth guys. It's just a myth.  you know the more smarter you are the more things that you could do security data privacy we're all gone like there is no data privacy in the world of uh you know internet right now but with ai that just gets worse yeah 80 percent 85 percent 90 percent i completely agree yep so that's what imad mustaki sees so now let's watch  You might be thinking Avinash, this guy is someone who I don't know. Show me someone who is big, talks in the similar line. I'll show you, CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang says something to you.  I think it's taking a little bit of time, guys. I'm sorry. I want to say something and it's going to sound completely opposite of what people feel over the course of the last 10 years, 15 years. Almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science. Everybody should learn how to program. And in fact, it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has the program and that the programming language is human.  Everybody in the world is now a programmer. You now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence. I want to say something and it's going to sound completely opposite of what people feel over the course of the last 10 years, 15 years. Almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science. Everybody should learn how to program. And in fact, it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program.  and that the programming language is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer. You now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence. I want to say something. How many of you think what he sees makes sense? Type in the word MS in the chat box.  the new programming language of the world will be their mother tongue. It could be Telugu. It could be English. It could be Hindi the programming language will soon become English and then it will become their mother tongue. How many of you agree with me type in the word MS in the chat box.  ms in the chat box. Yes in every time someone says 100% of programmers. It's not 100% guys. They say it for some other reasons, but it's 80% which is also a very risky stop and a very risky thing right and this is now being executed by github copilot. Let's watch this.  Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart. Maybe one day we'll all be able to live with just one heart.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  Guys, what do you think all the developers here? What do you think of this? This is the first step of making you 10x productive type in the word. Yes, if you agree with me and this is not the first company that is trying to do all this.  github owned by microsoft is doing this auto gpt is doing this potentially devin tomorrow could do this some people say something about it but yeah could do it and chat gpt also could do this potentially in the future there are a lot of  AI tools are doing this right now trying this type in the word. Yes, if you're scared to the I don't want to use any bad word here. But if you're scared to the death like if you're almost scared and your heart is beating twice as fast after seeing with this video type in the word. Yes as a developer be very frank. Okay, if this becomes reality, will you be scared?  and this is reality that three months this will be out github copilot workspace now the next version of github copilot perfect  You see guys, that's the world we are coming to, you know, no matter what industry you are into there is something AI could do to you. Coders, QA, data analysts, data scientists, paralegals, you know, market research analyst, teachers, finance jobs, traders, graphic designers, accountants, healthcare, insurance, media, customer service agents, art, music, video editing, digital marketing, no matter who you are, there is something that AI could do to disrupt your entire industry. Are you not convinced that AI is the future?  and AI will replace so many jobs yet. It is the best vehicle to make truck loads of money. If you start your you know, your exploration right now type in the word. Yes in the chat box type in the word. Yes in the chat box. And if you never typed anything in the chat box, but being a silent spectator and want to start engaging right now type in the word mean the chat box.  Now I see a lot of people were saying miss also. That's amazing. Thank you for starting to engage with me. The reason why I asked you to engage is to make content go into your brain rather than onto your brain. Perfect.  Cool that were me if you're writing something in the chat box for the first time and continue saying yes, if you've been engaging and agree with the statement that is flashing on screen. Perfect. Amazing is amazing. Great. Let's go. I need a commitment. We're almost one and a half hour into this presentation. I need a commitment from you. I commit that as soon as I know that AI is the best way to 3x my income.  Potentially I will go all in put your hand on the heart and read it out loud go Really go Declaration let's do declaration guys. Do we do we do it? Amazing Tapping the word mean the chat box if you really you know Read it out loud. I mean the word mean the chat box if you really did it  If not, at least do it right now. At least do it right now. Type it because declarations could change you. A lot of people don't know this but then yeah declarations could change it. Perfect. Did it type in the word? Yes, if you did it for in the at least in the second go type in the word. Yes in the second go. Perfect. Perfect. Cool. Let's go. So now let's understand what is mountain geologic like  Everyone wants to know this. Am I right? Type in the word prompt in the chat box if you want to know a little bit more about prompt engineering. People say this is the skill of century. Let's see why people say that. Prompt, prompt, prompt. Perfect. It's enough. It's enough. To understand prompt engineering, we have to understand software engineering a bit. What is software engineering?  human communicating with the software in a way software understands. To get the feature for his project. That's it. You go to VS code, which is a software and talk to VS code in a language VS code understands which is Python JavaScript all that to get a feature for your app or project. So this is software development. All the software developers do you agree type in the word? Yes in the chat box this chat software development. Yes. Yes.  Perfect. Similarly, PROM engineering is about humans communicating with AI in a language AI understand, in a way AI understand to get the best out of any AI tool he or she touches. That is PROM engineering. Like you go to ChatGPT, talk to ChatGPT in a way ChatGPT understands to get the best out of ChatGPT.  This is prompt engineering to be very specific, but you might be thinking Avinash then everyone in the world is a prompt engineer. Absolutely not. Let me give you an example. If someone goes to python right and write a code to add two numbers in python. Do you really consider themselves as a developer all he or she could do is to write a code to add two numbers. That's it. Nothing more advanced. Do you consider him or her as a python developer?  Type in the word yes or no in the chat box. Absolutely not right in a similar way. If you go to ChatGPT and write a one line prompt or two line prompt in a basic way. You are not a prompt engineer. You ChatGPT user. But a professional prompt engineer have a structured prompt in a writes it in a context that AI understands writes it with a prompt engineering technique that he needs to use to get the best out of ChatGPT.  That's the difference between a ChatGPT user and a prompt engineer. Perfect makes sense type in the word ms in the chat box. Perfect. Perfect guys. So now there are certain things to prompt engineering 25% of prompt engineering is about communication skills. You might be thinking Abhinash communication skills is 100% all you need to have communication skills. Absolutely not. In fact, when I mean 25% communication skills,  I am not saying about having fancy vocabulary, great grammar and all that. No, you don't need all that. The way you structure your prompt is 25% of prompt engineering which is communication skills. Next, 50% of prompt engineering is about right way of using prompt techniques, prompting techniques. What are prompting techniques? Pretty simple.  If you go to ChatGPT and ask to write 50,000 non-fiction, 50,000 word non-fiction book or 2,000 line code, do you think ChatGPT would be able to pull off just like that? Yes or no? Very, very, very, very humanly difficult, right? It's a little difficult. But if you want to do it in a professional way, having the knowledge of chain of thought prompting technique, tree of thought prompting technique, critic thought prompting technique and there are hundreds of prompting techniques like that.  So using those prompting techniques, you could both write a 50,000 word book of ChatGPT and 2,000 line code for your app just like that inside ChatGPT. So having the knowledge of 5 to 7 prompting techniques that you could insert in your workflow in professional life is 50% of prompt engineering.  And the last but not least is 25% of prompt engineering is about having knowledge of at least four to five professional AI tools that you could use in your professional life. ChatGPT, Jupyter notebooks, mid-journey, stable diffusion, depending upon your life, your career, you need to have four to five AI tools that you could use in your career. And combination of all this makes you a prompt engineer.  Next time when someone comes and says prompt engineering is just communication skills. 25% right, but 75% we have to have prompting techniques and AI tools. Type in the word MS in the chat box if this makes sense. Type it, type it. Perfect. The more engaging you be, the more energetic I get. Yeah, cool. So now this is prompt engineering.  So, these are the front-end engineering works and this is true for almost all the use cases. You could be content writer, developer, you could be, you know, a project manager who need to brainstorm and take a lot of decisions. You are someone who is a CTO and need to finalize your tech stack and want different people's opinion. All that, you know, you could use ChatGPT in this way to get the best out of ChatGPT.  There are two things, non-technical prompt engineering and technical prompt engineering. What is non-technical prompt engineering? AI users are non-technical prompt engineers. AI builders, developers are technical prompt engineers.  non-technical prompt engineers are the ones who understand back-end of ChatGPT or AI tools a bit, which we discussed in the starting of this webinar itself. They understand back-end, but they don't code. With zero coding knowledge or reliably no coding knowledge, they use ChatGPT or AI tools in the best way that an average user can't use. Those people are non-technical prompt engineers.  And the people who are technical with a lot of Python experience, data science experience or say NLP, computer vision, all these people, people with these experiences will be building these large language models or AI tools are technical front-end engineers.  lot there are less than like say few million technical prompt engineers anyway in the world but even a technical prompt engineer who is building the back end of AI needs to know the front end usage of AI to survive in the world because you're a data scientist it's not like you can't use AI in the front end to be able to take all your decisions  IT professionals spend 75% of the time thinking and 25% doing it is 50% of the people agrees with me. They do this. Sometimes they do a lot of coding only but a lot of people 75% thinking done could be done by AI. All the brainstorming could be done by AI. 25% of coding could be done by AI. ChatGPT, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, Copilot, Workspace, all those tools.  So your ability as a technical prompt engineer or a technical developer to use front-end will also be needed in the future. In fact, not future right now that is non-technical prompt engineering understood tag in the word MS in the chat box. If this totally makes sense tag in the word MS. I'll also see you how is what is the future of this non-technical prompt engineers and technical prompt engineers, right? So let's talk about technical prompt engineers.  Technical prompt engineers who are data science specialists are the last people in the world of developers to lose their jobs. Like I don't know when this will happen, but they are the last people because the more AI tools happens, this people needs to train the data. AI is nothing but data and data scientists do nothing but do the data training and all that. So data scientists are needed and are the last ones to lose their jobs, which is like the best safeguarded career right now for all other people. So that's technical prompt engineering or technical prompt engineers.  with a future proof little bit not like 100 years or 50 years maybe five years. Okay. So now let's come to non-technical prompt engineers. Very simple. Imagine there are 10 content writers in the company. Companies were hiring AI managers to manage this 10 people and transform their processes and systems to be able to use AI in a better way to make this 10 people do the work of 20 people. Let me explain.  20 member teams are being replaced by 10 members and on top of this 10 members they would have normal manager and then they would have an AI manager and this AI manager would understand every system every process talks to every single member for few days and set up systems and processes in such a way that everything that they do would be highly leveraged by AI tools to make them more productive.  and that will be the job of job of AI manager just to make team productive because 20 members are now being replaced by 10 members and companies needs to use this 10 members to do 20 members job and they need one person who is a manager and now they're just cutting extra nine people and saving a lot of money and these people  The primary experience of this people, the AI manager would be non-technical prompt engineering. The secondary or any other experience, secondary experience of this particular manager would be content writing from his previous job. So, anyone could be, anyone could make their prompt engineering as their primary experience by learning prompt engineering.  and then go to any industry and become AI managers. These people are often called AI managers, AI transformation specialists, image generation experts, non-technical front-end engineers, ChatGPT experts, mid-journey experts. There are multiple fields.  for every 60 technical prompt engineering jobs we have 40 non-technical prompt engineering jobs right now in the market and the best part is 60 for 60 technical prompt engineers we 20 like 200 people are fighting against it whereas for 40 non-technical prompt engineers only 20 people are actually applying for this to at 40 non-technical prompt engineers because this non-technical prompt engineering or generative AI engineering is just  a month old it's a six to nine months old so there are not a lot of people who know this and you are now amongst the top one person two person in the world who know a lot of technical prompt engineering typing the word makes sense if it is totally making sense yes perfect enough  If you learned about AI and prompt engineering more in the last 15 minutes from this prompt engineering slides than your entire two years 2023 2022 last in 2024 type in the word. Yes in the chat box. Type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you are learning more in this 15 minutes than last two years of your time. Perfect.  perfect not two years but my life thank you Deepika anyway so this is what prompt engineering is this is the difference non-technical prompt engineering is the way to go you'll see a lot of people want technical well non-technical prompt engineers in their workspace  Sometimes a technical person someone who's a python developer could be a non-technical prompt engineer and like lead the 10 python developers, but the more of his expertise in prompt engineering the ability to use AI tools in a better way and secondary experience of him will be python development from his previous job or her previous job. This is how it works. Perfect. Cool.  In 10 years, half of the world's jobs will be in prompt engineering. That means we have 1 billion white-collar jobs, 500 million of those 1 billion white-collar jobs will be needing prompt engineering or AI expertise in some or other way to survive their daily professional life. This is said by  Robin Lee, CEO of Baidu, a 50 billion dollar Chinese based company. And I perfectly agree with it. He says 10 years. But then I say five years, five years is more than enough, because this was said by two or three years back when AI is not a huge thing. But right now, the development is huge. Right. So in five years, we need 500 million prompt engineers or 50 crore prompt engineers  Do you now realize the value of prompt engineering because we have can anyone guess how many prompt engineers we have right now in the world non-technical type it in the chat box. Less than 1 lakh non-technical prompt engineers or 100,000 non-technical prompt engineers are there in the world 100,000 or 1 lakh to 500 million and 50 crores.  You see the gap and this gap could not be filled if the governments, corporates and universities, all three come together and try, it will not happen. They should have the war kind of mechanism. They should see that there is a war they are fighting with AI, only then this is possible.  Even then micro entrepreneurs like freedom micro companies migrate the companies like freedom with AI the founder. I'm the founder of it. Fortunately should come up a lot of it companies should come up and create this awareness about AI, you know guys the reason we what we do why why we do what we do is now we are on the mission to upskill one crore or 10 million individuals.  to create awareness on AI in the next three years. We are done with 150K or 1.5 lakh, which is 1.5% of our goal in the last 12 months. We have two more years to reach our goal to 100%. Hopefully, if you see this valuable, you sharing the same thing with all your friends and making them attend this masterclass will make us reach the goal of upscaling one crore people with AI so that, you know, out of 50 crores,  We have that one crore people, 2% of 50 crore requirement will be fulfilled by this micro IT company, Freedom AI. That's the goal. And thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for explanation. Great goal. I want to be one of them. Veda says, Lavanya, for everyone who's stepping in, all the kind messages. Thank you. For everyone who's saying all the best, congratulations. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks a lot for everyone who's saying all these kind words in the chat box.  Great all the best. Thank you all as well loving experience all the best. I want to be one. Thank you. Congratulations. Excellent, bro. Great great vision and mission. Thanks a lot. Let's go next. So now let's dive in. So now a prompt needs to be in certain format. What is that format? This is that format. When you are writing a prompt in ChatGPT, you have to start it with the first component which is task.  What is that one thing that you want ChatGPT to do or AI to do goes to the task? How you want the task to be executed? Goes to instruction component third component is context. Why are you even asking AI to do that particular task? What is the context behind it goes to context fourth component is parameter.  What are the rules and regulations that AI needs to follow while executing that particular task goes to parameter. After all the four components is a fifth component which is optional which is input. If at all you have any more things in your brain you want to do all the brain dump  and you want to kind of give some references to that AI to execute that particular task. It could be a reference source code reference article reference video. You could give that in the input format and that's fifth component. No matter who you are a developer content writer format remains the same. We used hundreds of formats and this gave the best results all the time type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If it is making sense. Yes.  Perfect. Let's go. Task. Let me give you an example, right? And this example is for content writing because everyone could relate to it.  So that's the reason we didn't do the developer coding stuff, but the coders also will have the same task. Write a structured response acting as a world-renowned CEO like Sunder Pichai, providing five main points on how companies can survive when their financial runways come to an end. Blah, blah, blah. That is the task that we gave to AI. Instructions. Begin with a brief introduction and then dedicate a separate paragraph for each of the five main points. Each point should be supported by real-life examples, blah, blah, blah.  goes to instruction. Context, the audience are business owners and entrepreneurs facing financial challenges in need of practical and insightful advice to navigate the situations. That's the context of the article. Parameter, the response should not exceed 500 votes and should consider the provided statistics and examples, etc. Parameters.  Input drawn your knowledge of business survival strategies financial management and entrepreneurial resilience about to provide a comprehensive response keeping in mind the acting role as a CEO next in the picture. This is how a professional prompt engineer writes prompts. How many of you are seeing a prompt this big for the first time type in the word? Yes in the chat box.  and have in the world know if you already wrote a prompt like this or saw a prompt like this in the past. Yes or no perfect. And this is the example guess this is the example. So now we got a lot of theoretical knowledge. We got to know a lot more with just this knowledge. You are in the top 5% in the world that have lot of non-technical prompt engineering experience. Now, do you do you feel that you are a little more smarter than yesterday when it comes to prompt engineering type in the word? Yes in the chat box.  Perfect. Now, let's implement all the theoretical knowledge that we have learned to build a real business. Let me build you an IT company in the blockchain space, just using one or two AI tools. Would you be interested in that? Type in the word yes in the chat box if you would be interested in seeing how I could build a business in the next 15 minutes inside GPT and one more AI tool at max. Can I do that? Do I have your permission for that? Amazing.  cool perfect let me open my chat gpt and the business that we are going to build is a tech company based on blockchain and bitcoin because bitcoin is growing super fast these days it is again trending people want to make money and all that and if you want to invest in bitcoin having the knowledge in a structured way understanding how blockchain works and bitcoin works is very important agreed typing the word agreed in the  if you agree with it. Yes, understanding how this works by investing 500 rupees, 1000 rupees, 20 dollars, 30 dollars is very important. Yes, blindly investing in a coin that your friend suggested is not a good financial advice. You have to learn, research and invest your money. Perfect. So now to understand about our product, there is a thing called ICP, Ideal Customer Persona.  And this is a concept from MBA, if I'm not wrong, where, you know, we encourage ChatGPT to give our ideal customer persona. Perfect. I will just.  Just a second guys. I wrote 15 points. I don't need 15 points. I just need five points each. So now what I did is I went to ChatGPT and gave this product. I am selling a cryptocurrency and blockchain course. Please answer this questions as my ideal customer persona ICP who is suffering from the problem of not having information about crypto or blockchain. Please give me at least five bullet points of every for every point from the fourth point blah blah blah. These are the points that I'm asking about my customers.  It gave me an example name example age example self-description this ideal and basically ICP is just you doing your customer research before actually starting your business. No matter if you're starting cafe or any other business understanding your customer and the market is more important than your marketing campaigns or your product or service in itself agreed type in the word. Yes as a business owner if you agree with this, so that's the reason we're starting our business  you know with ideal customer post on our market research and customer research. The self-description of my ideal customer is I am tech savvy professional who is always eager to learn you know about emerging technologies have dabbled a bit in investing and I'm particularly curious about potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to transform industries.  The primary goal of my ideal customer would be to gain a comprehensive understanding of a cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to make informed investment decision and possibility transition to a career in this field. Mechanism to achieve the goal, enter into well-structured and reputable course, regularly participate in online forums, follow industry leaders and influences, attend webinars and virtual conferences, engage in practical exercises like scaling, small trading or blockchain demo to apply the knowledge you got. So that is the mechanism.  Past feeling about the items felt disappointed, overwhelmed, frustrated, excited, anxious. Primary motivation to be at the forefront of the technology to achieve the sense of accomplishment by masking a challenging and relevant field. What are the unwilling sacrifices of my ideal customer?  You know sacrificing a large amount of time without clear and structured outcomes investing in significant money in courses over committing to a single niche primary and structured primary and secondary complaints lack of clear and stride for educational resources high volatility, you know to vast to fully understand blah blah blah. What is the ultimate fear duration of the interest past experiences reason motivating experiences common self-talk triggers for guilt sources of optimism  so much about our customer. How charge would you know all this pretty simple? It has all the data from World Wide Web. It crawled everything from the database from the prompt we gave because it's very structured and in-depth. It is not able to give us all this information that would otherwise take two to three months of your time.  Type in the word MB mind-blown in the chat box. If you are already mind-blown by the amount of research we already did about our customers. Guys, if you're from USA or any other country internationally, or if you're from India, figure out top startups that recently got it fun, recently got funded. Email them saying that I could do a deep customer research. I'll give it to you only pay me if you like.  and do this for hundreds of people and give this as $500 thousand dollars as a service just copy paste and just package it in a better way and give it to the average business owner who makes a million dollars in the venue a year. I am 100% sure 99.99% of business owners themselves in in USA or UK or any other country.  They themselves don't know what is ICP and if you give this much information about their customer, they would be loving you to the core and happily paying $500 because this market research of them or customer research of this will help in building a better product, better service and better marketing campaigns. Here is the $1000  per project idea for you. You could potentially make four to five thousand dollars per month by spending one to two hours, but just doing this type in the word ms in the chat box. If this is making sense. Ms in the chat box, please. Perfect. Perfect. Yep. Cool. So now that we almost have, you know, you know market research done. The next step for building our course is to build a curriculum, right? Every course need a curriculum.  from number one, copy and pasting it. What I'm saying is, hey, I'm building a cryptocurrency course. I need a curriculum of that with 10 topics with six topics, sorry, covering concepts from scratch to advance. So it is not creating a curriculum. Introduction to cryptocurrency and blockchain. What is cryptocurrency? History of cryptocurrency overview.  how it works, benefits, key terminologies, understanding blockchain technology, cryptocurrency mining, wallets and keys and addresses, crypto trading and investments, DeFi, NFTs, regulations and legal aspects of cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency security,  advanced topics and emerging trends. How many of you are into crypto right now? I'm thinking ChatGPT right out of the box gave an amazing curriculum. Type in the word crypto in the chat box. If you are into crypto and think this is actually good, type in the word crypto in the chat box. Yep, you see.  We got curriculum of our course in 15 minutes. How much time would you think this would take for a general curriculum designer to do? Type in the days, type in how many days or weeks that you need. Three weeks, four weeks, absolutely. We at least need two to three, four weeks in the best case.  to do a comprehensive research over the industry talk to some users and get to a curriculum like this and ChatGPT did it in two minutes just two minutes. That's the power we are talking about. So now what's next? I have a curriculum.  Which means this are all of my video ideas. I have 60 videos. I need to record from what is cryptocurrency to overview blah blah blah. I need to record 60 videos for every topic that ChatGPT suggested me and bundle it as modules and uploaded to the learning management system and sell it as a course, but I am very lazy because I am lazy. I need a easiest way to write and do whole process. What I do is have a prompt.  If this is already mind-blowing to you, this will be much more mind-blowing to you. I copied one module here and one of the sub module which is exact video idea that we got from Sajeev Pichai and asked it to write me a script for this video inside my course considering this as my final video script. I will just read this out loud with zero editing. You're an expert content writer with 10 years of experience in crypto.  I'm asking chat GPT itself to write a script for all the 60 videos. I do one topic do 61 at a time and complete my talk. So now let's see the quality of it. It even giving me it's even giving me the editors thing.  Hello and welcome. I'm thrilled to guide you through an exciting journey into the world of cryptocurrencies. Today, we dwell into the world of our modern financial system and evolution into digital transactions that set the stage of the revolutionary emergency technologies. Let's start at the beginning. Long before paper money and digital transactions, there was a barter system. Goods were directly exchanged for other goods. However, the limitation of barter system like  The need for double coincidence of wants led to creation of money. As societies advanced, we saw the birth of coinage in ancient Lydia, which is in Italy if I'm not wrong or in Turkey if I'm not wrong.  This was first standardized units of value. Later, the Chinese introduced paper money in 9th century and innovation blah blah blah. How many of you think the script ChatGPT gave is so professional and human? Tap in the word professional in chat box. Tap in the word professional in the chat box if you think this is very professional and human. Yep. I could literally read this word by word.  and record video putting all this on a teleprompter and read it like a news reporter or a newsreader. Can I do that? Can you do this for your favorite topic that you could coach type in the word? Yes in the chat box. Yes. Can you do this? Is it very difficult? That's option number one option. Number two is you go to a website like HN, which I'm copy pasting here and use AI avatars. You could literally deep fake yourself  right now and you could autopilot the recording of the videos from Hagen. You could create voice deepfake and video avatar deepfake of yourself and give the script to Hagen. Hagen will just create a video with your avatar with your cloned voice. In any accent and other languages also you need.  And you don't even need to record them. All you need to do is send 25 seconds recorded video of yourself to agent and agent will understand the patterns your facial expressions. Now all that hand gestures and we'll be able to record it and you do this for 60 videos done. You have a product that you could literally make millions off of the market. If you are a good marketing expert. For marketing what we need here. We need a website. Okay.  Yeah, we need a website right you will go to a website like 10 web dot IO or Framer AI tool, you know, you'll use this two tools to build your website. You literally give one from that ChatGPT would give you and paste it in this websites and your website your web building will be automated by this tools.  Since we want to go a little more advance of building a business. I don't want to build a business take 15 minutes of your time. Is it? Okay. Can I skip the website building part and go to more advanced stuff which you could do like it's very easy takes time, but very easy. Yes, having the word. Yes in the chat box, please. Perfect. Cool. So now imagine what our website is done market research is done building the product is done website is done marketing is the next need.  What's better than digital marketing in Facebook using Facebook ads? I am going to create an end-to-end Facebook ads campaign for this particular product in Sajeevati in a minute.  Act as an expert paid ads marketer with 15 years of experience. I'll provide you with all the necessary details and it will be your job to come up with an ad campaign and ads for it that can help the brand exit sales conversion. My client is this my target is this my budget is this and I wrote a prompt from all the experience that I have. I just wrote a prompt and it simply created a table created a campaign audience and all for the people who don't have context of Facebook ads marketing very simple guys.  Facebook will ask you 50 questions before you start any marketing campaign to understand your products or service better. That's it. Answering those 15 questions is the job of a distal marketer, but you don't need a distal marketer anymore. It is killing my own job of being a distal marketer and distal agency owner, but that's fine.  The table number one is campaign. It created a campaign, allocated a budget, created a campaign type network, answered almost all the basic level questions and then identified interest that we could target on Facebook that could potentially buy our product. People who are into crypto newbies, blockchain starters, investing basics, people who are into this categories tend to purchase our products faster. Yes, type in the word yes in the chat box.  Yeah, perfect. So now, yeah, so it created audience table and then now it is creating our ads table. I'll just write one more prompt. Yeah, okay. Perfect, cool.  So ChatGPT is now creating an entire table campaign ad group at type headline one description one and description two and it in the campaign that it created in the ad group it created. It's now creating ad type headline one description one description to for all the 15 ad groups that it created. If you are a distal marketer now and mind-blown. Talking the word MB in the chat box.  as a digital marketer, if you are a mind-blown type in the word MP in the chat box, Aryan, Saran, Joseph, Larry, Rakesh, Steve, Suresh, Nagaraju, Madhavi, Aditya, Abhiram, Joel. You see, this is what we're talking about. And that's my 15 minutes of time. We build a business. What else we need? Market research, website, product, marketing. That's all right. You don't need anything. You could start your business.  How is the Josh guys? How is the Josh? Type it in the chat box. How is the Josh? Hi. Hi. Amazing. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. So now that we are done with building a business. This are we doing good? Am I doing good or am I boring good or boring type in the word perfect.  great amazing good good good thanks guys i thought i'm boring uh the content is little technical a lot of people might feel it's boring but very valuable is what i feel but anyway thank you so now we have an extra bonus on top of 15 000 rupees for 200 dollars worth of bonuses we have one more bonus  All you have to do is simple. If you share something about this master class on LinkedIn, you'll get to if you don't have LinkedIn at least on Instagram preferably LinkedIn because it will be useful for you recruiters will see that you're upskilling on AI getting certifications and all it will impact you in a very good way, which will result in 150 not so obvious ChatGPT prompts as a bonus to you all type in the word bonus in the chat box. If you really is interested.  All the bonuses once you fill the form you'll get it. But this extra bonus is for the people who share something positive about ourselves in the in the community masterclass about this in their LinkedIn. They will get it interested. Perfect. All you have to do is very simple. Take screenshot of me talking to you right now. Take a screenshot of me talking to you right now and you could share this on your LinkedIn. Yep. Perfect. Yep. Take screenshots. Hi.  A I. A I. A I. A I. Anyway, people were asking to pose so just I'm posing A here and I here. So yeah, so you could just take a screenshot and along with the picture just write some good caption about your experience so that other people will not feel something gimmicky and they'll also know what you're learning.  and then you know someone from my team will you know come to you to understand like you know in dm you all that you know bonuses through a google drive and i would request kundan to send all the links that they need to taggers including freedom with their linkedin page my linkedin page so that there's high chances of my team coming to you and sharing all the things if kundan is busy let me do it myself yeah  Yeah, cool. So these are the links that you have to tag while doing this. Yep. Okay, I only paste copied LinkedIn. I'll also copy don't have LinkedIn page. Okay, perfect. Copy paste is not happening here. Guys, click on the link. If not possible is copy paste not working type in the word. Yes or no.  Okay. Okay, if copy paste is not working for few people. All you have to do is very simple. Just click on the link and copy it yourself is clicking working. It is click. Are you able to click the link type in what the word yes or no? Yes.  Yes, perfect. That's the more important that we have to do that. We have to have right now. So let's continue guys. Let's continue. We don't have a lot of time. We have 15 20 minutes to complete the next part of it type in the word done. If you're done taking screenshots.  Yes, perfect, great, cool. Now, the most important and needed topic is how to make money through AI. Yes, type in the word money if you really want to make some extra money using AI. Yes, type in the word money.  Guys, I'm already getting the tags. There is this guy called Raj Shekhar already tagged and even sent him the message. Really great session and all. Thank you Raj Shekhar and you could do it. Thank you. So now how to make money through AI.  I already discussed one way of making money is like selling, you know, customer research to USA people. We also discussed how to build a tech companies using AI creating your own courses and becoming a coach that second way on top of this too. I'm going to show you four easy and highly profitable AI businesses with less than 4000 piece of investment type in the word 4000 in the chat box. If you're interested in this 4000 is $50 for the people who are international.  Okay, the first business model is book writing with no prior writing experience. You could actually write a book using AI and you could use something on my journey to create all your images and all the marketing material could be done by Canva, which is the most important tool for the world for AI people all this could be done and publish.  You could publish this as a self-publisher on Amazon and make a lot of money. You might be thinking Avinash. Why should I trust you? Can you show me some case studies? Sure. This lady called Lena leads made $900,000 in revenue. In fact right now, it would be a million dollars in revenue using Amazon. She wrote it using AI like all the tools that she wrote almost 50 titles.  Everything is written by AI. She just got famous in the last two years if I am not wrong. This book you see here Star of Sage and Scream the owl star which series book one. It's a series of books 17 books and the first book of the series got 1600 ratings with an average rating of 4.5 or 4.6. If 1600 people purchasing her product on an average 10x people should actually purchase that  If you get 100 people purchasing your product, 10% of them will be giving you the ratings. That means 16,000 people purchased her product at $1 each making herself $16,000 just from one book.  And the second book in the series. I'll show you the second book in the series. Where is this? Where is this? Yeah, I'll start with series. I was face. Thousand ratings 10,000 people purchasing $5 right now. It's not $1 anymore suspense there $5 5x money $5 each and it's a Kindle version. The best part is it's Kindle version. It's you don't even need to do anything. It's just a digital product.  Hardcover and paperback is also available, but we are only discussing about the money she would have made in the worst case if everyone purchased is a Kindle like is a you know is a from people. For the people who read books getting 4.5 rating on good reads is almost impossible. Agree readers out there who know good reads 4.5 is a huge rating and this is done by AI and Amazon knows it.  Yep. Right. Now if you see, this lady here with thousand ratings would have made $50,000 from the second book itself. And she got 247, 151, 343, 446, 552, 9, 620, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If we combined everything, she would have got X ratings.  and we multiplied that X with 10x to get actual purchases and we multiplied that actual 10x purchasing into an average order value of 4 and she made a million dollars according to our calculation. Now, how many of you could take Lena Leeds as an inspiration and start writing their own book in ChatGPT and you all you need is maybe two weekends to complete your entire book using ChatGPT these days.  Type in the word yes in the comment section if you can take this as your inspiration and try making money with this. Yes. I'm not saying you the idea. I'm giving you how to do it with case studies of people that you could research little more upon and implement. Yes. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Yep.  Great. Of course, you will not be able to write Harry Potter like of things, but you don't need Harry Potter like good quality to make money all that. Yeah, anyways. Cool. Let's go to the next one. You could start a freelancing or AI automated marketing agency. Sitting from your home and make tens and thousands of dollars on top of it right now. Take my uncle as an example. You know, I have an uncle, my mother's brother works at Oracle.  you know in DB database management and stuff like that. 14-15 years of experience makes heck lot of money, very good amount of money because for 14 years he's into the same industry. So with 14 years of experience, a year back he discovered ChatGPT and other AI tools. He would be working for 5 to 6 hours or 7 hours a day  which are jeopardy. He reduced that six hours at max to three to four hours a day because it made him little more productive, especially for DBMS SQL and all it's it's very good. So now now this my mom or your uncle is now doing the same amount of work in four hours. Then he went to Fiverr and up for created freelancing profiles and started to fulfill the similar projects that he is working for his company or until  Not literally the same but in the similar line so that we don't even need to put a lot of brain right same office projects as a freelancer using AI tool. In the next three to four hours in his work time, like he would be working for four hours. He's still have for us extra time and he started to work as a freelancer and you know what he's making 2.5 X more revenue being a freelancer than his monthly job.  Damn his day job. How many of you think this is amazing? Type in the word amazing in the chat box. You know, he already have a three or four BHK apartment in Kondapur. Right now he is buying a villa in our, you know, I'm not sure villa or four BHK again, but he's buying it in Narsinghi, one of the biggest growing areas in Hyderabad, India.  Just imagine that like just one AI tool and being a freelancer changed his life and he didn't even work super hard just super smart. And you could take me also as an example tools. I used a creative at creative.ai Jasper.ai playground.ai flip.ai mid journey.ai all these are the tools that I use in my agency to scale it to 25 30 lakh rupees in revenue.  And we will be needing 20-25 people in our agency, but we only have less than 10 members right now in our active marketing agency. And we are using AI tools. You could take me or my uncle as an example and Lussa on top of it. Dukan, if you remember, 90% of the technical support staff were replaced with one AI chatbot.  And that chatbot was done by collaboration with a freelancing agency or some third-party agency with their internal team. If a freelancer or a small company could go to a half a billion dollar company and do this service of chatbots, building chatbots is a huge thing right now. Like AI chatbots to companies for internal purpose is a huge thing. And Dukan hired a third-party people.  And you could be that freelancer that could go to companies and offer AI related services and offer AI transformation in their company and make their own company better by giving your expertise to them and make money from that. This is the second, third or fourth way that we're discussing right now. How many of you could take inspiration from my mom or my uncle to be able to start your freelancing journey? Type in the word freelancing in the chat box.  Type in the word freelancing in the chat box if you would love to take inspiration and start your own freelancing career. You might be thinking Avinash, I'm not so very good at what you do. You don't need to. People across the world are looking for average people. They just don't have time. They are okay working with average people or basic people.  right and you could be a non-technical person or even non-IT person and doing design a handmade greeting cards or voice overs if your voice is good there are unlimited amount of opportunities that you could go to Fiverr  and fulfill projects and also fulfilling projects with AI tools could make you more money than anything using AI right now. One of the best ways to make money type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you now can trust me and do try this in the next weekend type in the word. Yes in the chat box.  Yes, amazing sell print-on-demand digital products guys, you know, there are websites like HC replica of Amazon, but in USA and which is very famous in USA, but also, you know, reliably famous in other countries also. Kind of little high-end not like Amazon cool stuff will be there. So people were selling digital stickers and digital planners and digital images on HC.  using mid-journey, they're creating it and they're using Canva to be able to create their marketing material. And all around the world, people are selling the stickers and digital products to the people who are in USA and making money from them. Yep, if you want to see an example, there is this lady called bilidesign.co. You know, all she does is sell stickers like this.  You know, stickers like this. That's it. At $4 each, you know, she sold 3.6 lakhs, I'm sorry, 3.6 lakhs of sales.  on an average order value of 4 even if you take 350 she would have made 1.4 million dollars from HC selling this digital downloadable stickers is digital downloadable. It's a PDF format. Someone has to go out. Print it from a mall or some digital sticker stop and stick it to their you know, tumbler, you know, you might be thinking it's very difficult to create this as a non-designer. I'll show you one way to do it.  Yeah, let's just ask ChatGPT to be able to get all I did is copy the description of the product itself. And then let's see how ChatGPT will be able to you know, create an image like that or not before that. Let's see one more example happy downloads.  Now this guy or lady. I think she's lady, you know, happy downloads sells digital planners and stickers and you know, how like see the stickers like I know all this checker email stickers. I doctors I test all the small small stickers is what she sells and charges approximately eight nine dollars and she  had 2 lakh sales with an average order of value of $5 each, she would have made $1 million by selling these digital stickers. You might be thinking, Avinash, why in the world people are actually purchasing the stickers for $5, $10? I would never do this. Logical explanation for here is people in USA, UK minimum  they make a $20 per hour. That's their minimum. Like there will be no one making less than $20 who are on HC shopping list. If they're making $20 of a minimum thing, to collect all the stickers somewhere from the internet, do it themselves would cost them 4 to 5 hours minimum. These are like 200 digital stickers guys. It takes a lot of time.  They are actually saving 4 to 5 hours or $100 by spending $5 that buying back their 4 to 5 hours time. That's what you have to look at it. And people don't mind spending 5 hours to buy back 4 hours of their time by just purchasing something ready-made. But this guy is leveraging one product selling it 100 people at $5 discounted price. No, and you might be thinking this is difficult. No guys.  to see this don't you think this tumbler sticker is actually good when you compare this with this like yes or no do you think not let's say good or not let's not discuss about good or bad but do you think i could list it on hc and make money from it yes or no is it almost as good as this particular thing  What I did, I didn't even do any prompt without any prompt just copy paste in the description over here got me this. What if I could prompt it little better and explain what I need. Don't you think I could just create this on ChatGPT post it on HC do this for 100 times list 100 products and make money. Yeah.  and you saw two people making money this way. Type in the word, yes, if you want to start HC store immediately tomorrow, if you want by taking this as your inspiration, yes or no. Type in the word, yes, in the chat box, if you want to take this people as an inspiration, yes, perfect. Type in the word, me in the chat box right now, if you're for the first time typing something in the chat box, type in the word, me.  For the first time for all the people who not once typed anything in the chat box type in the word me. I want to look at your names. Yeah. Yes. No type in the word me. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Thank you. Now continue the flow just engage with me the more engaging you are the more time you could spend on the more knowledge that you get. Anyway, let's go to the next.  We last but not least in the hacking every small tool and normal tool will become an AI tool will not will is becoming a tool right now. And the best part is ChatGPT gives you API access so that you could take hold ChatGPT features by taking API and build something on top of it. You could use a no code local SAS tools like bubble  and air table for your data management and you know, all that and bubble for your you know, bubble for your front end and your back end will be hosted by ChatGPT is API and build some useful product to the world and make money from it. You might be thinking Avinash. I know I'm a developer, but I know I'm not dumb to you know, I'm not dumb to see this making money. How many of you are feeling this way type in the word? Yes in the chat box.  If your view right now is this am I dumb not to understand this is so easy to make money. This is not possible. It's impossible. How many of you developers are thinking like this type in the word? Yes. Okay, I'm reading names. Okay, perfect. Great. Now, how many of you remember this? Lensa, you know in the hacking success story lens are used API of open source neural network model called stable diffusion.  which is readily available in hugging phase for chat, you know, GitHub and trained its AI and created a software. They created a software which is the front end by using some no codes as to like bubble and the back end is powered by stable diffusion. And that's it would have spent $200 to develop and $400 worth of server costs to start the whole thing and it become very famous Instagram celebrities shade their AI generated avatars and they have made 16.2 million dollars in revenue in 2022.  with eight million dollars happening in December 2022 alone a million dollars is eight crores in Indian rupees by the way just calculate how much money they made and this is 2020 tools data they would have made more money in 2023 because it's very famous in 2023. Now how many of you think you're convinced that you could make money using this this is the epitome of success stories where they are using some readily available  in a stable, readily available open source model. Yes. Are you guys convinced right now? Type in the word no, if you're still not convinced. Type in the word no. Be genuine guys. If you're not convinced, what I'm talking is not making sense. Type in the word no.

They created bots on Elon Musk a psychologist a Mario or you know, Joe Biden and all these people what they did is they took ChatGPT. Power of ChatGPT. They crawl entire information about that particular character available on the internet and created a chatbot and users who chat with this particular chatbot feels like they're really talking with those particular persons involved like Elon Musk and stuff like that.  They're just mimicking the real person and they created hundreds and thousands of chatbots and right now it is second most in a website with a lot of traffic after ChatGPT in the AI space. It is almost one time even bed ChatGPT for a couple of days and right now it's second highest viewed a search chat, you know, I know AI app.  and it's using ChatGPT API even now now I was convinced that in the word convinced or no, if you're not convinced type in the word.

She was just no so, you know, what should I do to make you convince that you can actually make money have one more girl a 16 year old Indian girl launched an AI company in 2022 and it is now valued at hundred crores.  The name of the lady is Pranjali Avasthi and her company is Dells.ai. So now if a 16 year old could do it. Average age of this webinar attendees would be somewhere around 200, sorry, somewhere around 30 to 40. Can't we do it? Can't we do it?

If you know what you're doing type in the word. Yes, if you agree with the first statement in the in the screen type in the word. Yes, even if you never typed in the word, yes type in the word me right now type in the word. Yes, if you also agree with the second statement, which is prompt engineering is a skill of the century type in the word. Yes, if you agree with the second statement. Yes, amazing type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you agree with the third statement, which is making money from a eyes is not very difficult.  It's not rocket science. Yes and type in the word. Yes. Yes. Yes for three times in a message. If you agree with all the street statements. Yes. Yes. Yes in the chat box. Perfect. Thank you. Now, let's recap what we have learned today in the last two and a half hours approximately. We have learned three things number one safeguard your future and how AI is evolving faster than we can imagine and how to be prepared by spending few minutes a day.  Type in number one in the chat box. If you have learned point one point to what is prompt engineering and why we need millions of them in next few months type in number two. If you have learned the point number to type in number three, if you have learned five ways to make money using AI with less than four thousand rupees of investment. In fact, we did six weeks. Did we do it? Type in number one, two, three. If you have learned all these three things type in the one, two, three.  Amazing amazing. So now type in the word great. If you feel we over delivered on our promises having the word great in the chat box. If you if you feel we over delivered. Wow, 400 people saying great already. Thanks guys. Thanks a lot. So now let me ask you a question.  How many of you realize that you could lose your job in next one to two years and you won't be able to take care of your family. If you kind of ignore AI right now type in the word. Yes in the chat box type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you ignore AI right now, there is a potential possibility of that happening. Yes.  Yep, so don't ignore AI. Second, let me ask you a question. How many of you realize whatever we learned in the last two and a half hours is less than 1% of AI? Agreed? All the developers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, type in the word, yes, if you think what we have learned in the last two and a half hours is less than 1%. Someone is saying 0.1%, bro. Exactly. It's less than 0.1% that we have learned about AI in the last two and a half hours.  There is a lot more to learn. Imagine you're feeling like this by just equipping yourself with point one percent of the world of AI how fulfilling it could be if you could at least get 10% of the world of prompt engineering AI and non-technical prompt engineering agreed. Yes. Perfect. So now the only thing left right now is to get going and you have three options in front of you.  Option number one or path number one do nothing with what I have learned today. I'm 100% sure no one in the webinar right now would choose to go with path number one. If you're doing it, you're borderline bad.  It's a bad thing guys. Don't do the path one. It's the worst thing that you could do to yourself. You spend three hours approximately with me right now. And if you're just doing nothing about the information that we have learned if you're not implementing now having knowledge doesn't matter only implementing matters. Yes agreed type in the word. Yes in the chat box if you agreed.  Path number two, take what we have learned from this masterclass today and expand your knowledge on your own.  While path 2 is better than path 1, the problem with path 2 is lack of accountability, lack of motivation, and lack of a perfect roadmap and guided mentorship to do 3 years worth of work in the next 1 year or 6 months. How many of you agree doing all these things on your own is almost impossible? Type in the word yes in the chat box if you think expanding your knowledge on your own is very difficult. If you would have done that,  You already have one and a half years since ChatGPT release. You would have done that already because you don't have the correct roadmap. It gets very difficult. It gets very demotivating. It gets very time-taking agreed. Yes. Perfect. Yeah, but not impossible, but it's very difficult. That's what I'm saying.  So now part number three leverage our experience and let us help you to protect your career in the world of AI evolution by partnering up with freedom with AI. How many of you want to choose part three tab in the word three like if you would love to choose part three.  by partnering with us and continue the journey with us, maybe even from tomorrow for the next one year. If you want to continue this journey, if you feel that energy that you got in the last two and a half hours is the same energy that you want to continue having for the next two, three, and six months, one year, type in the word three in the chat box. Absolutely, right? I want to continue.  Perfect. If so, I do like to ask you permission to tell you more about the most exciting program. I have ever created with a deal of a lifetime that will never be available again tab in the world. Yes in the chat box. If we get 50% of you people saying at least yes, right at least 500 people 16 people saying yes, would love to talk about that. Yep, we got 200 people saying yes till now.  I'll just sit in the meantime. Perfect 300 people saying yes already 350 400. Perfect. Perfect guys. Perfect. We got 500 already almost done to 20 of perfect. Perfect. Let's go next.  Since all of you almost said yes, we are inviting you to join our new program which is Freedom with AI membership. How it works? Pretty simple. It's like Netflix, but for AI. Just like you watch web series on weekend about some random, you know, thing. You come to Freedom with AI.  in this one year and learn a lot about AI from tens of courses and hundreds of hours worth of content that we created especially on AI so that no matter who you are an IT or non-IT or any kind of working professional or executive or a business owner or a student you could spend your time and gain a lots and lots of knowledge in this membership freedom with AI is Netflix, but for AI.  How many of you are excited? Type in the word excited to know a little more about us. Type in the word excited in the chat box. Perfect, perfect. Perfect. Before we brag about ourselves, let us show you a couple of testimonials and see how learners are feeling. This is Reena from Germany. I've been following Avinash on Instagram for a long time, say one, two years.  And as soon as I came to know he's giving a masterclass on AI, artificial intelligence, I just didn't wait for a second and registered myself for the IA class. The masterclass was really, really great. I also took the membership for one year and it's been just one, two months into the membership and we have learned so much. There's a lot of content that he has been sharing with examples, everything, tips and tricks.  And there's still a lot of time to go, a lot of months. And I'm already overwhelmed, but we are going to learn everything. I suggest you all to do, attend the masterclass, take a right decision, and do also the membership, because you are going to learn a lot. I've never seen someone so dedicated and so honest. The way Avinash tells you tips and tricks and everything, he has himself been trying.  No one is going to do that. So I just suggest you all to do that and you will never regret it. Thank you. And she's from Germany, NRI, you know, Rina. You know, very sad story, but I just wanted to narrate it. And, you know, one of the huge success stories of Freedom With AI to date, you know, what she did is, you know, she basically  Someone in the family lost the job. She has to become the solo breadwinner of the family at one point for like a few months and she got two kids, four and six. She joined us, maintained the family, attended the job in the day and then in the night she used to complete the course content. Three months down the line after all this, doing all of this,  She managed to publish two self-published books on Amazon and started to make a good amount of revenue to fulfill her family's needs. And that is Reena. And this makes me more emotional and inspiring than Elon Musk launching the second rocket. Because we've been able to help someone in need to, you know, scale their income. How many of you think  This is true for you also type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you feel inspired from stories like Rina the other than anonymous successfully launching the next rocket or ChatGPT launching some next AI stuff. Yes. Yeah, and we have the second testimonial from a guy called Vinay and he's from Pune anyone from Pune type in the word. Yes in the chat box.  So I recently bought this course Freedom with AI from Avinash and it was definitely worth the money like I know the money which I invested I will definitely make way more money back in return because the things work whatever he is teaching in the monetization methods and everything about AI definitely this course is structured in a way that it has all the things you need to succeed  like he's teaching the skills, you have all the content available, then you have a mentor, that is Avinash, he's already been successful at running his agency, scaling it to seven figures, then you have the community of like-minded people like me, like we have the community of people who are learning and trying to make money with AI, doing things with AI, but if it has all the three things, you need to succeed. Definitely Avinash has been a great help,  like he does QnA calls frequently and answers all your doubts even if it's not directly related to AI it's related to making money online like building an agency so he helps in everything he can to help you so definitely if you want to start making money with AI or using AI to make more money to  Increase your efficiency. This would be the best course. I think it was definitely worth the money. So Vinay joined a few months back with us right now, you know, he's from Pune took a eardrop 20 year old. He's making 2.5 lakh rupees on an average per month from his email AI based email appointment setting agency. He works for USA and UK clients.  and he may he's making to 2.5 1.5 to 2.5 lakh rupees per month on an average and he is 20 year old guys 20 year old i hope we'll be able to talk to him for 10 minutes in this session itself in 15 minutes we'll have him talking to us to share his experience but now see me one thing if a 20 year old could make an extra two lakh rupees or three four thousand rupees three four thousand dollars would you be able to make it yes or no type in the word yes or no  if given the best interest of yourself and two to three hours at max per day like one hour is more than enough but two to three hours like is the max do you think you will be able to do it do you trust yourself type in the word yes given the same amount of guidance that i am giving you for the last three hours will you able to do it do you trust yourself yes it's enough if you do it  And get to that 2, 3, 2, 4, 5 thousand dollars per month or 2 lakh rupees per month. What would change in your life? I would love to know that. Like what would that mean to you? Someone says my kids education. Wow. If that's the first thing that you got into your brain, you're amazing mother. Thank you. Family standards, everything. My whole life, Anaya.  my family's future, financial stability, my debts, help my parents, better medical assistance, life insurance, my dream, travel, confidence, better clothes, I can totally relate, help my family, daughter's education, daughter's life security, to make my credits, college fees, my own life, freedom of life,  And that is what we are talking about. It gives you more freedom and that freedom could be achieved with AI. That's why we have freedom with AI guys. Financial freedom, helping people, charity, giveaway, self-confidence, better life to my family, better standards, daughter's life. I would get cook and made for my home.  Sumita, you are amazing. I can totally relate to you. I can totally relate. You know, 10,000 rupees for a cook or 5,000 rupees for a maid. A lot of people do all those things. But you know, you could spend a lot more time with your kids and husband or wife or all that. Yeah, support my husband.  Cool. So now let's go here is how freedom with a membership works pillar number one. You will get action-based videos to upskill yourself with our massive hundred hours plus video library. It's right now 200 hours by the way that can that you could watch for the next few months. It's a one year membership by the way for 365 days. You could watch it.  by the end of this year, you will get instructions, guidance and community support from 35-40 countries to help you support every step of the way. It's not just about the community, it's also about the community manager that we have, who you could get on an onboarding call, get a personalized roadmap, understand all your needs and get the best out of this investment that you're trying to do.  Pillar number three, weekly two live classes. You can attend at least one to teach you more advanced concepts and clear all your doubts. Pillar number four, weekly accountability. We will ask you what you are doing the last week, what you're planning to do this week, and how much you did. All that tracking of progress could be done and could be taken accountable.  How many of you think the four pillars are amazing? Type in the word four in the chat box if you think the pillars sounds amazing and would love to know more. Type in the word four. And everything that you're trying to see right now is properly gamified. Like I'll also show you a little bit of that towards the end and what you're going to get.  The first course in this whole thing is freedom with AI blueprint which covers foundation of AI applications and prompt engineering for dummies like who are starting out with our prompt engineering for all those people.  especially the non-technical prompt engineers by end of this you could literally become a non-technical prompt engineer and apply for the jobs. And by the way, we also give you job assistance. We will give you how to write a great CV how to talk to talk to people in interviews and we'd also give you three to four hundred job listings on AI every single month that you could go watch. This videos and apply for the jobs that we're trying to give you all that and freedom with a blueprint covers prompt engineering.  and all the job assistance too. So, you see people from IITs and IBDs comes to us and say that you have better resources even when you compare with my college when it comes to non-technical prompt engineering.  you might be from IIT Bombay but you will find better non-technical prompt engineering resource or videos than your college in us in our think and I could bet that if your college seems to have a better product of non-technical prompt engineering don't mind.  it's I'm 100% sure on that there are like tens of people said the same we are the best in the whole country when it comes to non technical prompt engineering right now in 2024 and in the month of May we would be top three I'm saying with all you know don't feel that I'm just hyping up but then with all the honesty with all the things people say to us and I'll also show you a lot of reviews that we get and you know so that so now  Once you complete this particular course, you will be able to do SEO content, YouTube scripts, write books, do a lot of coding stuff, bug fixing, code documentation, explaining coding techniques and concepts, marketing campaigns from scratch, all the things that you're seeing here done by AI. Add copies could be done by AI. HR and recruitment activities could be done by AI. These are like top 10, but there are 100 different things that you could do apart from this, but these are very basics that I wanted to cover.  That's the first course valued at 25,000 rupees in India. The value of this particular course people other people sell is a minimum of 25 30,000 rupees with this kind of content and the whole guidance and community in USA people are selling it for at least $2,000 $2,000 is what people are charging for this kind of content for only one course, but we are just valuing it at 25,000 rupees.  and image prompt engineering mid-journey mastery or stable different mastery and talented mastery. These are the top three image prompt engineering tools that you need to get to be a proper image prompt engineer.  On top of ChatGPT. You also need to learn how to generate images so that you will be able to do logos like this thumbnails like this blog post images like this add creatives like this photo realistic images like this UI your screens like this every single screen that you're seeing on screen right now. All the screens are actually generated by AI. If you are a UX designer and mind-blown type in the word UX in the chat box.  Yeah. You see, this is what I'm talking about. It could literally do a very complex visual design like this right now from scratch using AI.  And you could be able to do game assets like this if you complete this. You could be able to generate graphics for children's books like this, animes, print-on-demand products. You could sell this kind of products on Etsy or other e-commerce stores. Fashion and textile designs like this could be done with AI. Professional mock-ups like this. And interior designs like this. And image prompt engineering is valued at 20,000 rupees.  In India people sell this niche course of image prompting staring at 30,000 40,000 and the USA people sell it at 3,000 4,000 dollars. I'm talking about the same in-depth courses that we if we compare this with those they charge a hell lot of money. And now we are valuing our course very nominally at 20,000 rupees total value of this two courses in the market is 45,000 rupees, but because you stay till the very end and completed this master class.  This is only going to be available for you at 20,000 rupees or 242 dollars. This is a silver membership type in the word silver. If you would love to enroll and at the price of 20,000 rupees of 242 dollars only for the people who type in the word silver will be able to send you the links directly. If you don't type anything will not be able to send you the links type in the word silver in the chat box.  And then we created something called gold on top of silver to make this 10x more valuable. But why pricing it like 20% more than this? That's it. So now what we did is silver is dedicated by me like, you know, or my team. Three months after the launch, we realize it is amazing feedback that we are getting.  What we thought is hey, if people are almost being so overwhelmed from the knowledge that we have by ourselves and feeling so valuable, how good it could be if I could bring my own mentors who taught me AI to teach my people, my learners. That's what we did and onboarded our first mentor called Madhu Vamsi. He did a course called AI for Developers. If you're a developer, this guy, you could literally see him as like a demigod after knowing about him, just joking.  But he got 5 research papers published on AI and ML with a very high citation score making him one of the top 100 data scientists in the whole country India. And he did internships with ISRO, worked for ISRO, worked for many other multi-billion dollar company, been there, did that.  and now teaching you on how to use AI for all the developers. How many of you think this course could be your game changer type in the word game changer in chat box. If you think this in this could be a game changer and just to keep your perspective gets to give you a perspective. If you have three research papers published on your name, you could get a PhD on the particular, you know area and this guy have five of them. Think about it.  Very high guys, very highly valued and very less known. He just don't talk a lot in social media and one of very good friends and we onboarded for him and the course minimum the value the kind of content we have in this course is almost 20 hours or 10 hours and I think 20 hours. Yeah, 2022 hours and the value even we say it's 50 $60. It's 5000 rupees. That's what we are valuing very nominal value. And this is all gold goes.  He also created one more course for a a course where we teach you how to build chatbots simple to complex free to paid we covered everything in between and I could say hands down. This could be the best chatbot building course in the history of internet. I could say that you could literally build very complex chatbots using AI APIs of time security and this could be the most complex and the most in-depth course that you can get.  when it comes to this particular a a course again dot by mother. How many of you want to make money by selling chatbots that in the word chatbot in the chatbot chat box right now. I'm the word chat box. Telling the word chatbot if you really want to know and understand and make money using chatbots. In the worst case guys worst case, you might not be able to make money in the worst case, but the good case here is. You will be at least building chatbots  that you could put on caption projects in your CV or resume and show the whole world, show the next company that you're joining that you had a lot of AI expertise. That could be the worst case scenario.  And even that is a lot better. You are increasing the weightage of your CV by adding the certifications and resumes, you know certifications and capstone projects. The value of this course is 5000 rupees and we onboarded one more person called Rama Katunga. He worked at Michael, you know, Microsoft Intel and Samsung at one point. He headed entire data team at Samsung and we bought him not to teach you remember we bought him not to teach you data science, but to teach you how to crack jobs how to pick it how to prepare your resumes  and give you the job assistance. He himself hired thousands of hundreds of people for his organizations and help thousands of people in job prep. Remember guys here you see observe things. I'm not getting a random head start to you to teach you how to get a job in the world of AI. I am getting someone who is head of data at Samsung to teach you that. Type in the word game changer in the chat box. If you think this could be your game changer.  And then the fourth mentor we onboarded or third mentor we onboarded is Leela Shankar. He is AI for he created a course for AI for self-employed business owners and marketers and he works you know as a growth consultant and marketing consultant for almost 100 startups at WeHub and T-Hub. For the people who don't know T-Hub it is the world's largest incubation center.  located in Hyderabad, India. Bigger than all the USA-based, you know, things. It's one of the, not one, THE, THE world's largest. He works there.  mentors hundreds of startups and he know how to use AI and he worked at multiple companies in USA as a CXO like and been to the board members which is like 3,000 4,000 members uh employee companies as a CXO he worked and then came back to India mentors hundreds of startups we bought him  to teach you how to be a better business owner better self-employed person using AI.

So now  Can I take two minutes of your time and share a very personal story of mine that I generally don't share anywhere on social media? Can I take two minutes of your time? That would be the end of our presentation. Can I do that? Yes. Thank you. Thanks a lot guys. You see in 2021, I lost a lot of my net worth into cryptocurrency. I invested in Bitcoin and all. Although I invested certain money and made a little bit of  Profits, but in the long term, I lost a lot of money in crypto. While crypto is crashing during that period of time, we used to have 75% of our clients from the world of crypto and 75% of them, all of them off-boarded with us because they don't have marketing budgets. When crypto is crashing, other cryptocurrency companies also don't have a lot of marketing budgets.  We went from 25 lakh rupees in revenue to 4 lakh rupees in overnight just in a week or two. We have 14 members in our payroll.  And it's been two months this happened. I don't know what to do. Employees were just resigning left, right, center because there are no projects and we're not able to pay salaries on time. I have money, but a lot of that money also vanished into cryptocurrency crash that I also personally experienced. And I have some fixed assets like lands and all, but I can't sell the land to run my company, right? It gets very difficult.  You know almost at one point I even sold that lance and stuff and you know to just pay the salaries 3-4 months later in the April if I am not wrong or May  I lost my grandmother. The grandmother that showed me the world of business by starting her business at the age of 16, she used to do export of pickles business. She used to sell Indian pickles in USA, UK. She used to sell it for all the people there and in locally she used to have a curry pot. Like all the curries like dal and all that she used to do and she used to sell.  and they made 25 lakh rupees of pure savings in the five years and lot of gold and traveled whole country my grandfather and grandmother together they did this and she is a main pillar and that inspired me at the age of 14 11 to 14 somewhere around that she inspired me to get in the business and I lost her I'm already in the personal crisis and I lost my grandmother  That is like the worst thing that happened to me. But at least some way I'm accepting she's like 65. She saw her life. She's happy. I was trying to convince myself that someday she should go and she's very peaceful. Everything is what I thought. And then convincing myself to get out of that grief. Just in two days, we realized my mother and father, both of them tested COVID positive and went on to hospital. They were in ICU fighting for life for almost 14 days.  And luckily, we got our father back from ICU and COVID because he's double vaccinated since he's 46. In India back in 2021, May, June, you don't have vaccinations for people under 45.  And that took away my mother's life. My mother is 44 and we just lost my mom because she is single vaccinated. She's not able to cope up. She's not able to fight. She got all two chronic diseases. And we just lost her. I still remember.  Now the reason she lost her life is because a lot of antibiotics usage in the beginning which we can't complain because that's the thing because of using high antibiotics she got periods like 15 days before her actual time and she was not able to fight for life in ICU because she is very weak when she gets it right and she is in the 44-45 at that point of time I can totally understand I'm like now I'm understanding but back then I didn't understand anything  And nurses are saying that it's worst. Flow is worst is what the nurse used to say. My mom at one point said, kill me. Literally, I would rather die rather than being like this on a ventilator and do all this.  And at one point, doctors also came in and asked, do you think it's a good thing to make her fight like this when so much things, so much blood, so much is out? And I was like, no, she has to fight. And then, you know, I still remember I didn't have the last word with my mom. I was in the lift. Two minutes before I reached my mom and my brother and my mom, she's gone.  I went to depression. For three months, I didn't even come outside the sun, literally.  My businesses are almost on the shutdown. I don't have anything to do. Like I have like one or two people still working with me, but without taking any money and maybe making a lakh or two in revenue at that point of time. And these people are like doing charity. My clients know that I'm going through this and they were just with me for two years. They don't want to cut the relationship. I'm not delivering anything, but still they're paying me. I don't know. I'm super grateful for them at that point of time. Yeah.  That's my story guys. At that point of time, this guy, Leela Shankar, drew to my home and suggested, man, you are going through a lot. I know you're almost shut down. Start using an AI tool called Jasper. That changed my life. One tool, Jasper, back then it's Jarvis, changed my entire life, guys.  From that one tool, we discovered more AI tools, like four, five to six AI tools that changed the trajectory of my agency. From two lakh or a lakh rupees in revenue, we went back to 14 and even 25 lakhs in the next six to nine, somewhere around nine months.  All we did is fulfill lot of SEO based projects by getting our content at bulk faster and productive using jasper.ai at that point of time. One AI tool because of Leela Shankar changed everything for me. And then I realized the value of AI and how amazing AI is which saved my life literally, which saved my business. I also realized the cons of AI.  I'm so emotional right now thinking of my mom. I was just literally stopping my tears but then I don't want to make it look unprofessional. Anyway.  So all this is happening and no luckily we went back to the whole you know friend and AI saved us. We got to know the power pros and cons of AI then decided to do a whole edtech company on that completed a course in 2022 by the end. Then ChatGPT also came in which helped us a lot in 2022 ChatGPT is out in the month of December and then I went on to experts to ask how much I should price this particular course.  I remember one line my mom said in the month of Jan or Feb when I am going through personal financial crisis.  She told me Avinash you're making rich people rich, but you never made a middle-class businessman or a poor businessman or someone who is like not super rich. You never helped them and created a mass impact. Maybe in your next startup or next phase of business start helping masses and create impact don't count impact in money. If you invest your money in your energy in someone else to make them more successful.  . So then I went on to see I did some calculations and realized 9997 plus GST or $144 for silver would be the best price to sustainably profitably grow my company at a 10-20% EBITDA margin SO the silver member will be cost for only Rs9997 plus GST or $144.  just for next 15 minutes and 40 members. This is a silver membership prize and for the gold. It's not 65. It's not 30. It's only 13 997 plus GST or 202dollars. So GST would be somewhere around 18% for Indians for everyone. So yeah, so this is how it works.  Just for 15 minutes and 40 members. The reason why we only take limited quantity is because we wanted to give the best experience. If you take more than 40, no matter how many people more we hire, it's little difficult. So we only have 40. Type in the word gold or silver in the chat box so that we could give you the access.  And I'm sorry for not able to take more than 40 guys in 10-15 minutes. Generally, once we open the slots give you the payment links it runs out, but we can't help to maintain the quality. We have to do it and Kundan will be sharing the links of those things in the chat box. Perfect.  You know, you'll also get the certificate fill the certificate form in the last link in this in this particular series of links will be the certificate and we have lot and lot of EMI options, which are no cost EMI options. Okay.  Yeah. And we also have GST input. If you're a business owner, 18% GST input will be given. 16,500 is the final price for the gold. And we have a lot of EMI options that you could use. This is the EMI option. We have almost 13 banks, HDFC, ICICI and all that. And you could use this three months, six months, nine months, 12 months, literally you're paying 1300 rupees, like literally 1300 rupees per month.  to to be with us for the next one 12 months yep 12 months 1300 rupees each no cost zero percent interest we will give you the discount before you paying us  your credit card company will just cut the discount and you will if it is 16 000 will cut like 14 000 and all the interest will be paid by will give you a print uh you know discount on the interest it is for all the indian people and for us unfortunately we don't have that emi option yet but uh you could convert it from yourself so this is how the freedom with ai gold membership works and silver also the same thing so so uh perfect and let's get  Vinay on board.

In USA, there is no concept of placements only. You have to search for your own job. Lot of people in US and UK are struggling to find a good fit for the job. And it is very important for you to have that one or two things that every other student don't have.  If you are a digital marketer, run AI-powered marketing campaigns using AI for creating world-class copy, VSLs, LPs, landing pages, end-to-end Facebook and Google Ads campaign and much much more.

Business owners, you have more written on investment.  in this course than anyone else because you're already running a business generating a little like two lakh three lakh rupees in revenue investing 16 000 rupees or 202 dollars could be a game changer for you and finally what's happening in the job market due to ai right now according to linkedin ai to progress 65 job skill shift by 2030 in the next six years now query says prompt engineering ai have a lot of scope and demand in india  While a lot of people are losing jobs, prompt engineers are making hundreds and thousands of dollars on a monthly weekly basis by charging hundred plus dollars per hour as AI or prompt engineering consultants on Upwork. You could see a couple of screenshots here. And 36% of IIT Bombay, one of the best colleges in the whole country, India and top 10 or 20 among the whole world,  they were not able to place 36% of the people. Can you just imagine that if you are a private engineering college chances of you getting placed are 10% or less and if you're from IITs 40-50% of IIT people are not getting placed and 36% of IITians in Mumbai is not getting placed. If you're a student you have to think.  Private instituting colleges sees a 50 to 70% drop in placements in 2023-2024 year. India already is seeing a job scene shift early signs of disruption from AI according to the Economic Times. Financial Times says generative AI set to affect 300 million jobs across major economies.  And Andrew says Goldman Sachs predicts that 25% of jobs in the US and Europe could be automated by generative AI systems like RGPD, impacting 300 million full-time workers. This could lead to a decrease in the number of jobs available, as well as a decrease in wages of those who remain employed.  Some jobs that are most risky of automation is lawyers, translators, accountants, data entry clerks, financial analysts, administrative staff, software developers, customer service representatives. These are the top five ten, but I could say two or three hundred more fields are going to be impacted in the white collar space in the next two to three years because of AI.  And one of the very really cool testimonials that we got is from Kishan. I really hated the idea of giving Avinash any money for his course. Why should I pay? There is so much free stuff on YouTube. It made me mad. Then I saw his free webinar and it made me even madder because it was shockingly good. Way better than the free stuff. I paid for his course grumbling about it. And you know what? It was annoyingly excellent. It blew my mind.  You know, when you see something is done very faster, it annoys you. But it's excellent that you are getting to know about that annoying AI tool firsthand so that you could be the more productive employee than other people. Yes.  Yeah, we have no cost EMI available. In fact, for six months, you're all you're paying is 2767. But we also introduced 12 months EMI right now. You can also pay for 12 months.

You don't decently get a meal in USA for this price in a decent hotel or a restaurant. And in India, it's almost the same.  If you go out for a restaurant, you spend 1500 rupees in India. Same with US. And you can't get even a cup of coffee at half a dollar in USA, UK. And in India, you can at least get a cup of coffee. That's it. All you're paying is 45 rupees or half a dollar per day for the next 12 months.  on yourself to protect your career, right? So what else do you need?

You go to any IT company in the whole country, India, 99% of the company, only top, hardly you will find 10 IT companies in the whole world have this kind of rating. I can assure you that.  And we are one of, luckily, we are one among those companies that are rated 4.9. Like you see these people, this is a top-notch learning center, you know, for AI concepts. We can create our own route map for many business ideas. The team was incredibly supportive, guiding us to the implementation process and ensuring that we're comfortable with the new technology.  can generate easy money by completing this all modules of AI tools. This is the world's best mentor like Agnes Lila Shankar. I've worked as a lead developer on one of the companies resigned one year back due to personal problems. I have joined this course two months back only and gone through three models as of now.  15% completed gone got confidence with the course on how to use AI like botpress blah blah blah and I have developed sample chart bots integrated blah blah blah. So this is what Kiran Kumar says, you know, Ravi says I'm following Avinash on Instagram based on his readings on AI got enrolled for masterclass.  During the masterclass, I was not sure about how AI tools will help me, but having a discussion with Avinash during the Q&A session, it felt like it was going to help me a lot. Today, I joined the call again to clarify the same with him. His energy is contagious. You know, you go read our reviews. It will take you one whole day to complete all the things with us. Like I saw your interview on YouTube. I learned many things from the webinar, life-changing masterclass, AI hand-holding, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

But then if I don't trust my own product and pitch to help hundreds of people in the world, who will do it for me? I have to do it, right? But not anymore. That's it from my end. If all this did was safeguard your future in this AI era in the next few months, would that be worth it?  If all this did was finally make you 3x more income and get your financial freedom that you always wanted, would that be worth it? If all this did was help you at least 5 to 10x more productive and spend time with your family, would that be worth it? Yes. Yeah, frequently asked questions.

You know, let's start with Maliya Varapu. Hi Maliya Varapu. You can turn on your mic and you can speak. Okay, let's go with the next person who is VV Satyanarayana. Hi VV Satyanarayana. Hi, good evening Yavraj. This is VVS here from Noida. Actually, I am from Vishakhapatnam. But however, I got inspired you through following through the Instagram.  But, you know, I have been using ChatGPT for quite a while. Though I am at age of 52, I am trying my best to, you know, how does it can influence my job. But I had different, I am in design environment at present, but I am really a construction industry person and I am core into the construction management. So, I am looking at lot of venues. If at all I sign up from the current position, that what way this AI can help me  a while coming back to my native so how does I can make better use of it both in terms of for designs and as well as the project management because I am also now MBA in project management so could you throw a light on the how does it can.  So end of the day, you could do both. You could come be in the design field or, you know, or this field, you could learn mid-journey, ChatGPT and all that. And you will be able to, you know, get the best out of your design industry. You could be the AI manager that people want. Or in the worst case, you could be the designer who is more productive.  Option number one, be the designer who is more productive in a company by introducing AI tools in your workflow. You'll find all the AI tools that you need in our membership, number one. Number two, what you could do is you could literally, you know,  change your industry and go to any industry where your primary experience will be prompt engineering and secondary experience will be in design. That could be point number two or point number three. You could use prompt engineering to become a better project manager by using chat GPT by managing people setting up systems and processes to streamline your processes and know  understand how systems work and how to communicate, how to give the deadlines, create proposals, make people work, all that could be also done with AI tools. So, these are the three options that you have, we research in our end. Yeah, but we can, can we, you know, we can feed the data to check the health of the projects using AI tools? Yes, we can. There are a lot of things that you could do there. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.  Thanks a lot. And let's go with Balakrishna. Hi Balakrishna. You can turn on your mic and we can speak. Hi Avinash. How are you doing? I'm doing good Balakrishna. Thanks. Yeah. So actually I got laid off like couple of months ago and I'm still looking for the job. And I actually stay in Canada, but I'm here in Hyderabad right now.  So I will be moving back to Canada. I'm also a resident there and I'm doing my job trials from here, from Hyderabad. Once I feel like I got an opportunity, then I'm planning on moving back to Canada. So I'm wondering like, you know, how exactly do I, I'm actually, I used to work as a test engineer, automobile test engineer, like automation test engineer.  And right now I'm looking as a business analyst roles and either the CRM also. I'm actually, I also have a good knowledge on the Salesforce.  So Salesforce admin, basically, I can say. So I'm looking for jobs in like IT right now. So I was wondering, like, how do I use these resources and a very good opportunity in the IT and also, as you said, that we can do a side hustle with this. I wanted to initiate a small side hustle first. And when I feel confident, like, you know, yes, I can make this work out in a big scale, then I'm planning on  giving my full concentration on the business only. So my final goal is in a couple of years I need to own my own business and move back to India completely so that I can be with my family.  Perfect. That's a good strategy. Like, you know, firstly, you have two options, you enhance the weightage of your resume to get a better job in Canada by mentioning about generative AI certifications plus caption projects that that you are going to do when you enroll with this option number one, but to also concentrate on the side results that you could build while doing this. And once your side results are on point, like you could choose to be investing more in business or maybe  enhancing your career through your job, you could do it. And for this, I do need your help regarding this, your team help or your help like for the mentoring, for the side hustles, like how can I get into that?  So, well, this can be discussed once I'm done with the courses because I do know that I've bought the gold membership. So, it does give us like a business ideas or like, you know, how can we use these tools and everything. So, I'm hoping like in  Like, in a couple of months, in three, four months when I'm done with the course and when I need help in getting, like, brainstorming the ideas of how exactly this can work, I can ask for your guidance. Yes. That's what I was wondering, like, how can we reach at that point of time?  Oh, sure. Like first we have an onboarding call. We'll give you a personalized experience of how to do things and roadmap and all that to you. Kunal will be getting an onboarding call with your person one-on-one for 15-30 minutes. And then from there, once you're done with an onboarding call, we'll start the whole process. Even when you have doubts, you can always reach out to Kunal. He will be your point of contact. And we also have community managers on top of Kunal. So you can reach out to any one of them and get all your questions answered. Yeah, sure. That sounds great, Avinash. Thank you so much.  Thank you. Thanks a lot. And guys, the format to talk here right now is just share your experience of this masterclass. Share where are you from? What do you do? And if you have any question, that's the fourth one. Perfect. Let's keep it in a proper format that will just be having good experience with other people. Let's go with Orlinda Pinto. Hi, Orlinda Pinto. Hi, Avinash. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you?  Good. Thank you so much for, you know, letting me chat with you for a little bit. So, you know, just my feedback in general about the entire webinar. I think it was absolutely mind blowing. It's great to just hear about like the different strategies and techniques.  I've been dabbling with chat GPD for a while on my own, but never truly to the extent that, you know, I mean, today I was blown away in terms of like what I can do. So, you know, thank you so much for all the information that you collated for us and shared. And, you know, also,  appreciate you sharing your story, your personal story, your personal journey in terms of, you know, what you went through and how you kind of emerged from it. So very, very inspiring.  So thank you for sharing that. And just a couple of questions. I think I'm going to piggyback off what the person before me spoke. And it seems like a lot of it was answered. But what I wanted to, from my perspective, you know, I'm currently in the US. I work for one of the top 10 banks in the world. I am in the product management space. Specifically, I've pivoted into the AI side of things.  So yes, I've already purchased the gold membership, so I've pivoted into the AI side of things. So I wanted to learn more about like just different techniques and applicability so I can kind of A, use the skill set to kind of explore more use cases from a product management perspective within my organization. And B, the bigger goal is I want to learn from you and the entire team and just all of the content that you've put together and Q&A and so forth.  How can I use it to kind of move into, you know, into obtaining financial freedom to kind of start my own business, right? YouTube monetization, Etsy, things that you talked about today, just brilliant ideas. And I, you know, even if it's in a pilot stage, I want to get the ball rolling on those aspects. So at least I can, at some point, you know, kind of have the choice to wrap up my job just like the person before.  and kind of, you know, focus on my family, my kid and be able to do, you know, a little bit like just have a business or focus on like my income streams, you know, alternate income streams. I don't want it to be limited to one. I want it to be limited to multiple things. So are you guys going to be helping us through all of that as well?  The first thing you can do as a project manager at a financial bank is to cover a lot of front-end techniques that will help you to streamline the process, automate a lot of tasks, write better emails,  and communicate with the people, do the decision making that you have to decide. You know, you could brainstorm your ideas with ChatGPT in a certain way. The way ChatGPT will act as like different roles to give different perspectives with different mindsets. And you could just pick a one. You could even ask ChatGPT to argue between different perspectives inside ChatGPT itself, which is called Tree of Thought prompting, which we covered. And yeah, the things that you could use like this to enhance your career as a project manager, number one.  Number two to make little more money as a side hustle and you know kind of get into the side hustle stage by spending a lot of time with your friends and family so yes that is definitely possible like you saw Vinay a 20 year old Indian didn't even complete you know  you know, engineering started his journey of making money online. You could also choose one among 30 businesses that we suggest and continue the journey of your AI as a side hustle also through those modules so that you could start making money from AI. And while you're attempting to do this, you might have a lot of confusions, roadblocks for which we have community managers, support staff, and success managers to help you out.  Great so would you guys also be providing those like just different ideas like hey you know YouTube monetization just one of it right like you know Fiverr you talked about some freelancing. We have a course called AI monetization just for that.  Right, okay. So, okay, so we just randomly pick the topics of what we are interested in and kind of look at it because, you know, sometimes there can be so much content, it can be overwhelming and not everything's applicable. And you can just get into like this analysis paralysis kind of phase where you're just consuming content and not taking any action, right?  So I want to be able to execute, begin executing, even if it's small, uh, sizable, uh, you know, goals that I set and I'm, and, and I'm able to like measurably make some, you know, execute something rather than just consuming courses. Like there's tons of stuff on Udemy and whatnot, you know, I mean, I study it, I get it done.  Get my certification and then three months down the line I forget it. I do. I'm being very honest because you're just like bombarded with so much information everywhere. So I really want this to be. I'm hoping that this will be interactive to the point where I can at least get the wheels in motion, you know.  So then I can then take on from that on rather than it just being like courses and courses and courses and I'm just like overwhelmed with courses and then it's like done, you know. Yes, that's where we come in. We are totally different than your self-paced. We have self-paced life classes.  community support, capstone projects will not only make you study, but also implement things that we are teaching by giving you all that, you know, we have a lot of gamification also. We have an entire social media app that we build for our community that kind of gamifies the whole thing.  So, we will give you points for watching videos, maintaining your speed, you know, helping others in the community. We have point systems for everything. So, this will gamify and make you feel like, okay, I am achieving something for the things that I am doing. Okay, let me achieve 100 more points today. Let me attend the live class because that is 100 points. So, this is how the gamification that we do inside. So, this way you will be like a kid again, you know.  figuring out points and stuff. So we'll make you implement things as much as we can. But we can't help you do things, but as much as we can, we'll make you implement things. Okay. Makes sense. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you, Avinash. Appreciate you giving me the chance to speak with you. And of course, even for me, the end goal is I want to move back to Mumbai, India at some point. I've been here for like 20 some odd years. It's great. It's not bad. It's just  I do, I kind of feel like I'm missing out the best of my life, you know? Yeah. So I do want to make that pivot, which is why I kind of want to transition into, you know, just kind of having a certain few things on autopilot in terms of revenue streams. It doesn't have to, it doesn't have to be outrageous either, but at least something that I can, I can keep, you know, myself like comfortably afloat and move to move back to India, you know? So that's, that's the end goal. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.  Thank you. And let's talk with Samant. Hi, Samant. Hi, Abhinav. Hi, Samant. How are you? Thank you for allowing me to speak for a while. I'm a non-IT guy. I work for Amazon. I stay in Hyderabad. We work for North America, but we support from Hyderabad. So it's regarding the transportation specialist.  So really, it's a very good event. I didn't believe that I'm here for like four hours. We started at 7.30 and we couldn't move away from the laptop. It's really a great session. I'm looking forward and I think it's just the beginning. I don't know how to start and how to move on but  Practically I could see that it could be definitely a winning game or a good start up for us and I hopefully a few who already spoke before  I can understand like what is the purpose of it and how it's going to be, how it's going to be life changing. I believe it is very positive and thank you for the session and I've seen you on a YouTube with some motivational speaker or someone. So I just signed up and thank you. Yeah, I'm looking forward. I don't know how to like, you know, move, move, move further, but as you just guide us, we'll keep on following. Perfect. Thank you.  Yeah, so for all the people who need who want the recording of the session will be available in our back end. So there is learning management system that you'll all get access to in which you'll have masterclass bonus as a whole thing in which you can watch the recording of this particular masterclass. Perfect. Good. Let's go with P Indra. Hi Indra. Indra you can turn on your mic and speak. I think Indra is busy. Let's go with. Hi. Hi Indra.  Hello. Hi. I'm Indra. Uh, students right now studying in Tharnavati University of Gujarat. I just use this chat GBT, uh, Bing, BARD or other AI tool just to generate images. But I really don't know that such great stuff we can do by using AI. Only in this webinar, I came to know that that is really helpful, I guess.  But as a student, I want to know more about how this AI will help for us as students. Like per day, if we spend two to three hours in a day for learning what your course tells us, we can really not only generating about the money, but gaining the knowledge a lot. How far we can gain the knowledge without sometimes without doing the coding also.  Right now, I'm focusing my career on data scientists, but still rather than focusing on data scientists, if I am feeling like if I focus on your course and curriculum, I may be more richer than that. I started feeling that. So definitely there's a possibility of a non-technical prompt engineering making more money, a technical prompt engineer, because someone who builds the, there will be a situation where someone who builds the car  you know someone who drives the car is more richer than someone who builds the car right so data scientists will build the car and someone who drives the car will be the non-technical prompt engineers and the people that could be the scenario in the future yes I agree with you but yeah data science is no less of an industry it could be the last industry that could be disrupted with AI frankly so you what you're doing is good so now for you as a student you could do two things okay  enhance your data science learning using AI, you could be having super complicated complex concepts. I'm sure data scientists with NLP specialization or computer vision specialization, you get a lot of complex topics. You could use ChatGPT to get the best explanation as easy as a 20-year-old or 18-year-old would understand. That's something you could do, number one. Number two, yes, you could make money even as a student because  that you know who is the person I just forgot his name Vinay. Vinay is like you, a 20 year old guy from Pune did it. You can also do that. Number two. Number three, adding generative AI capstone projects and certifications in your resume gives you 25% more experience. You could say you have data science projects and data science things, but on top of data science, if you could also add generative AI stuff, you'll also have little more, you know, importance and little more weightage in your placements.  These are the three, four, five things that I could think of when it comes to you. Sir, one last problem, please. Sir, as a student right now, I don't have a credit card. I only have a debit card.  I really wanna join but still if I say my parents regarding about this course they will say shit this stuff is they don't understand only about the AI sometimes to be frank they don't have the knowledge about AI they will say nothing you can do just leave it but I wanna gain this course so if possible somehow can you help me I can pay through EMI I can do that if possible please consult my request sir that will be really grateful to me I can  Yeah, I got it. So, we get to the sequence. Yeah, fill the form link. Yeah, I have already filled it. Perfect. Someone will call you and see what request we could do.  Thanks a lot. No problem. Thanks Indra. So guys, if you want to have a call back from any of our mentors or any of our counselors, fill the form that I just sent and you know, we don't have a lot of slots for that also. We can't call 100 people, 200 people.  in a given day or two. So we have two slots both for gold membership silver membership is done. Don't enter into silver membership right now. We have two gold slots and to call back during webinar slots. If you are interested in something just be type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you're considering to make the payment right now type in the word. Yes, because we need to see how many people are paying and accordingly we could accommodate how many of a people type in the word. Yes in the chat box. If you're trying to make the payment right now.  Amazing. We got Indu saying yes, Kiran saying yes, Aryan saying yes and Ashok saying yes. Amazing. Cool. Let's see how Vaibhav Gaitwad saying yes. Cool. Let's go. Let's talk with Shivakumar. Hi Shivakumar. Shivakumar, you can turn on your mic and talk. Or we can go with Malik B. Hi Malik.  You can turn on your mic and talk, Malik. Hello. Hi, Malik. Hi. Yeah, it was a nice session. Just a couple of questions. I'm an IT consultant. I'm working in UK. Due to layoffs, I lost my job a couple of months ago.  Currently I'm trying to learn some of the AI courses like I have gone through your videos and other things. So today's session was also very useful. Just want to know that. So what is the like you have mentioned about the prompt engineering and other things like so what is the you know.  opportunities in the UK market and any idea regarding that, how to build up the CV and other things. It means how it will be like once I do the course, like how it will be, any idea?  yeah so so if you are a consultant you can also consult people on non-technical prompt engineering and help them establish systems and processes using AI so you could be the prompt engineering consultant on freelancing websites to start with immediately because you also have that consulting uh experience in past number one number two you could also get a job a little faster in UK market maybe in other markets also  When you say that you are a generative AI expert, certified expert, plus you also did a lot of caption projects and stuff. So you will be valued more at an organization than someone who don't have AI expertise. So these are the two things that you could do immediately to, you know, up, up, fasten your career. Okay, one is generative AI and another one is prompt engineering, you mentioned? Yes, yes.  Okay, that's good. Thanks a lot, Avinash. No problem. Thank you, Malik. And let's go with Rajkumar. Hi, Rajkumar. Okay, cool. Let's go with Varun. Hi, Varun. Be Arun or Varun, I'm not sure. Hi. Thank you. This is Varun Shah from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  Anyway, thank you. You are talking many hours and I am astonished how you get all this capacity to talk hours after hours. Thank you very much.  I actually came here and I already signed up for the gold membership, but just randomly. So I work basically in the construction industry and I work for the planning and schedule and we have some tools using. So nowadays many things are converted to AI and I believe construction is one of the industry which are lagging in using the AI.  So my first target is to understand, to dig into the AI systems and all these things, and then I will try to connect with the tools currently we are using in the construction industry so possibly we can do that.  But I have a request since we live in the most of them are many of them are from North America. So your classes schedule should be matched with our time. This is one thing because we prefer in the weekends or in the evenings.  where during your morning is our working time, sometimes our night time, right? So your night time is our working time. So please consider this. Yeah, we have the classes. The second thing actually drives me, my son had just, I have a son and he's just completing his graduation and looking for a job in the data science industry. So I have a plan to, once upon a time, I'll plan to talk with him.  and whether I can introduce him with you so he can understand better. This is in the near future, I have a plan. So that's all. I do not want to take more time and with and over the progress of the course, I will be interested to talk with you more.  Thank you very much. No problem. So, we have one live class for international people, one for Indian people. So, we have two live classes. One happening Monday 6.30 a.m. Indian Standard Time, which will be Sunday 8.30 p.m. for you. So, I think for two hours, I think one hour, one and a half hour you can manage on Sunday evening. And for EST and IST also, for EST and PST also the same. So, yeah, we will have a class live for your time zone.  Thank you very much. Hi Raghavendra KP. Hi Avinash. I am Raghavendra from Bangalore. Bangalore, Karnataka. The session was very nice and majorly I liked in this one is like bots and how the learnings it will be and it will be like helpful for most of the IT sector.  by creating the boards of our own it will be like improve ourself and even in the companies like any other MNC companies or any other companies it will help them like calling activity and even so many tasks can be automated but how we can do  in because in companies like any companies, we don't have access right how we can implement of our own automation. No problem to two ways number one create fiber and up work profiles where companies will be searching for people like you and come and you know, give you the gigs or you can apply to the companies that you could build chatbot services on number one number two.  write an email like go to LinkedIn write a LinkedIn message. You can also find emails of the people who are funded on online and also LinkedIn message them connect with them have an organic conversation understand what their needs and wants are and then go pitch your services get on a call with zoom with them on a zoom explain why you are the best how you are certified how many caption projects you did and just give a very good guarantee all that.  and then close them. So the two ways that you could get international clients and close them. Okay. Thank you. Cool. No problem. Hi Chitti Sujana. Hi. Sujana if you wish to talk you can turn on your mic and talk to me. It seems like she's a little busy and let's go with Subbu. Hi Subbu. M Subbu. You can turn on your mic Subbu.  Hi, can you hear me? Yes. Thank you. Thank you bro for the session. I just want to say thank you and yeah, I paid it and yeah, looking forward to the course. Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. Doing good work. Yeah, thank you. Let's go with Sandeesh. Hi Sandeesh. Okay, Sandeesh seems a little busy. You can turn on your mic Sandeesh or let's go with Vamsi Krishna. Hi Vamsi.  Sandesh, Vamsi, Vidya, whoever turns on their mics and talk, we can have a call. Hi, this is Vidya. So Avinash Garu, congratulations, a very good course. My full name is Vidya Mahankali. Mahankali is my last name. Calling from Fremont, California. I'm a Java developer here in the authentication team in our cloud.  company and I am interested in this so much information online on chat GPT and AI and basically it is being bombarded as somebody pointed out earlier. I wanted something very concise and focused on how you can learn these skills and actually apply them  to whatever it is you want to do. I am on the side, I am very fond of telling stories. So I want to maybe perhaps go into writing a book or get on YouTube. I am not really sure. Just thought it is interesting to get into a course which will capture quickly actionable tasks that you can  perform to go from not knowing anything to actually have something tangible at the end of just looking forward to that. The one question I had was what is the format of the class place? I mean the inner circle. What is what should we expect there? Is it like a free form class or is there like somebody who's instructing you on topics? How does that flow?  Okay, so you all the concepts that are like in the market for 1 year, 2 years or all the basics and the fundamentals will be covered. Yeah, all the basics and fundamentals will be covered by the self-paced recorded course. You'll watch it at your own time, maybe 2 hours, 1 hour a day or a 4-5 hours on a weekend. You will spend and complete the courses there. And Inner Circle course is where some expert or mentor comes in and do two things. Number one,  Talks to you about the new and trending topic. Recently, Meta released Meta, you know, GPT. We talked about that. Samsung released Samsung AI mobile phone. We literally bought a phone and talked about Samsung AI and how it is something that you could do all the AI features in your mobile phone. Auto GPT came and we're talking about that. Anything that is very recent in the AI advancements, we do maximum in a week. We do talk about that particular concept that has very newly available in the market.  That's number one possibility. Number two, advanced concepts. Number three, Q&A for at least half an hour to 45 minutes like this. You'll directly talk to mentor, give the roadblockers, or if you have any questions, suggestions, you could literally talk to the mentor directly like this, like a one-on-one call and get it started. Three things.  1 out of 1 month like we have 4 calls right per month. 1 call will be directly by me where we will not discuss any new topics and only concentrate on clearing all your road blockers questions and give you a road map for the future. I personally get like 100 people in this inner circle calls approximately. 50 people might have questions. You will learn a lot from other people's questions than your questions. So we will do that deep Q&A once in a while.  This is not really one-on-one. I mean, we have like 40 people on the call, so that's fine. And so the self-paced coursework, do those come as a bundle at the beginning or is that sent on a periodic basis? No, it is bundled. I think you have already gotten an email in which you will find all the courses accessed in LMS.  Okay, I see. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thanks a lot. Bye. Let's go with Indra. Yeah, whoever I didn't speak just turn on the mic and then you can ask the question.  Okay, did I speak with everyone in the panelists? My love, Aruppu, if you want to talk, you can talk. And we have Bansi Sandeep, we didn't talk. Have you noticed a good question, Orlando? Yes, sorry. Do we just log into the LMS and see all of those nine, 10 bonus access there? Or is that going to come in separate emails as well? You'll get emails.  Like, you will have the bonus access immediately. Got it. And is this possible just for you to pull up that? I just wanted to take a quick screenshot of it for my own reference. The last couple of slides where you were sharing the bonus content, just so I can, you know, I have something to go back and reference it. Cool, cool. Yeah. Thank you.  I have this, but you had something with all those bonus listed like bonus 1, bonus 2. Yeah, these are the bonuses if you see, like you know, including bonuses and real, these are the whole course material that you get. Oh, okay, okay, got it, okay. Anyone have any questions? Just turn on the mic and speak. No problem.  Perfect guys, perfect. I think that's amazing. Cool. I hope we had a great Q&A. And cool. That's it for this masterclass. I hope you all had a great experience. You know, see you tomorrow. It's not see you tomorrow. For the people who enrolled, we'll meet again on Monday. And for all of them, until next time. Bye bye, guys. Thanks a lot. Bye. One last question. Do we get that recorded session for today's?  Yes. Yeah, not today's, but the recent masterclass last three, four weeks may one masterclass will be already uploaded in your LMS. Whenever I finally gave the best experience, we'll add the best possible masterclass. And do we receive that in an email or email? For the people who enroll in Gold or Silver, not for everyone. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. I'm a Gold member, so I'm expecting so. Yeah. Pranush, finally, just I have a long question.  You know, I have been listening to all the people in the community and each has got a from a different backgrounds, you know, how do you come a fledge each and address the each and individuals requirements the way you take walk through this course. Yes, I'd love to hear from you. Yeah, so the skill of learning ChatGPT reminds the same irrespective of your career, right? We'll show you how to fish the way you fish.  and we you have to do it right like what we will say is hey this is like prompt engineering this is the prompt format this is the prompting technique this is how you talk to them these are if you're a like say if you are uh having something like this this is how you code this you do this we'll share you all the things  Some tips will be applicable for some people and whatever is applicable. You'll just catch it and then use it on top of it. We have some specialized courses for developers project managers, you know, all these people have some specialized videos on there where you could get a specific thing wherever we feel a specialized course is not necessary a simple, you know, explanation of prompting techniques is more than enough. We didn't have a course but wherever we feel the dedicated thing is needed. We'll do that.  Imagine Google search. Okay, you're going to Google. No matter who you are the way you use Google the techniques you use to get the video or the image or article that you want remains almost the same ChatGPT like that.  Like although I don't want to compare things, but you know, prompt engineering is much beyond what Google search does, but I'm just giving you some random example to just connect dots. We'll give you the way, we'll give you the process, and you take it and implement it in your career. Because it's one app that you all have to master by end of this one year. Okay. Avinash? Sorry, thank you.  Just quick question, what about like, you know, I mean, yes, this course will have access for one year. I understand we may not have like ongoing support and whatnot, but what about, you know, just being able to go back and maybe reference a certain course that you might want to look at? Or you, you know, you didn't say do a certain business idea now, but you want to look at that course a little later on. Do we have like some sort of lifetime access to just the course content itself?  Unfortunately not the reason is we have to constantly update and we have to pay for the resources that we have to cover to update the course content. What's available right now might not be even available only because if that doesn't make sense. So we have to constantly update and even evolve and add new things because every new week there is something sensational happening in the world of AI.  So we have to constantly have the mentors recording more and more videos to cover up those costs. It's subscription like Netflix like three months later. If you want to watch a movie, you don't have subscription just renew it something like that, but it's an yearly membership. Okay, so but then you don't offer, you know, obviously you're not going to update the entire course content end-to-end right like there might be certain, you know, like and it's added and so forth.  Don't just add every movie. Let's not delete and add. So, do you not offer them something subsidized in that case for, you know, ongoing members who want to continue? Think about it. I mean, it's something to take back to the table and then bring it back, you know, again to the audience. Thank you. No problem.  Thanks for the idea here. And PPTs and docs are downloadable though, not the videos. But yeah, we'll just literally think about it in our next meeting with the team and we'll get back to you on this in a couple of months once we have a decision. Anything else, guys? Cool? Yeah, thank you so much for the great session. Thanks so much. Yeah, I'll have it. Bye-bye.  Bye. Bye guys. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye guys. Bye. Bye.
